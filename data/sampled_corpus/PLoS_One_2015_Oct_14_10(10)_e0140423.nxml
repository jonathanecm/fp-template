Focusing on tree diversity, soil erosion control, and climate change mitigation through carbon storage, we surveyed vegetation and monitored soil loss in various land-use areas in a northern Bornean agricultural landscape shaped by swidden agriculture, rubber tapping, and logging, where various levels and types of disturbance have created a fine mosaic of vegetation from food crop fields to natural forest. Tree species diversity and ecosystem service production were highest in natural forests. Logged-over forests produced services similar to those of natural forests. Land uses related to the swidden agriculture system largely outperformed oil palm or rubber monocultures in terms of tree species diversity and service production. Natural and logged-over forests should be maintained or managed as integral parts of the swidden system, and landscape multifunctionality should be sustained. Because natural forests host a unique diversity of trees and produce high levels of ecosystem services, targeting carbon stock protection, e.g. through financial mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), will synergistically provide benefits for biodiversity and a wide range of other services. However, the way such mechanisms could benefit communities must be carefully evaluated to counter the high opportunity cost of conversion to monocultures that might generate greater income, but would be detrimental to the production of multiple ecosystem services.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received financial support from CoLUPSIA (EU Financed Project - DCI), AusAid (Agreement 63650 with Center for International Forestry Research), CIRAD, CRP-FTA (CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees, and Agroforestry) and ABIES (Ecole Doctorale Agriculture, Alimentation, Biologie, Environnements et Sant&#x000e9;).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Drastic land-use transformations have occurred in the tropical forest landscapes of Southeast Asia in the past decades, leading to the disappearance of natural forests and the replacement of traditional land-use systems with monoculture plantations. On the island of Borneo, the lowland rainforests are at the crossroads of multiple and divergent interests. While these rainforests are hotspots of biological diversity with a high rate of endemism and hold important carbon stocks, they are also a major source of valuable timber, and are situated on lands that are very suitable for conversion to oil palm or other large industrial plantations [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Since the late 1960s, logging has affected most of the lowland forests [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Following the boom era that lasted roughly until the 2000s, large areas of logged-over forest were left unmanaged. Although several studies demonstrated the important role that these forests play in supporting biodiversity and maintaining multiple ecosystem services [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], they were slowly depleted through illegal logging and finally converted to oil palm plantations [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The detrimental effect of such large-scale land clearing on biodiversity and other services is an accepted premise [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At the same time, as the extent of industrial agricultural areas keeps increasing, the role of traditional agricultural systems (swidden i.e., slash-and-burn and rotational fallow farming, and smallholder agroforestry systems) vs. alternative agricultural systems in providing goods and services has received much attention [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To date, however, there has been little consensus about their role in supporting biodiversity and producing ecosystem services.</p><p>Since negative correlations usually exist between goods and services (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]), human-modified land-use areas would not be expected to produce levels of services similar to those of natural forests. Yet, in Sumatra, under low management intensity conditions, mature rubber gardens were found to have a plant species richness similar to that of nearby natural or secondary forests and to store substantial amounts of carbon in aboveground biomass [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Swidden fallows were also shown to reduce soil erosion and contribute to soil nutrient cycling to levels similar to those found in natural forests [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, studies in West Kalimantan found that an increasing number of shifting cultivation cycles naturally led to a decrease in tree species richness and important tree composition changes [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Some argue that such human-modified land use will not allow any long-term conservation goal to be fulfilled, partly because maintaining tree diversity might hinder rubber garden productivity [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Overall, despite current debates about the capacity of human-modified landscapes to protect biodiversity and support ecosystem services, these landscapes are getting increasing attention for their contribution to biodiversity conservation in the global context of vanishing natural habitats [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Research gaps concerning the effect of land-use changes on the ecosystem services produced by swidden systems have been identified through a systematic review currently under progress that aims to bring unbiased evidence to the debate [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While demand for food and goods is growing worldwide, and biodiversity and services are being lost [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], such information is essential to building sound land management strategies and guiding decision making on land-use planning.</p><p>In this study, we address the following question: What level of biodiversity and ecosystem services are found in the different land uses related to the traditional forest&#x02013;swidden agriculture system? We conducted a case study from a northern Bornean agricultural landscape where we quantitatively estimated the contribution of various land uses to: (1) climate change mitigation through carbon storage in live aboveground biomass and topsoil, (2) tree species diversity, and (3) soil erosion control. The two services were chosen because of their relevance for multiple beneficiaries at different scales (local to regional for soil erosion control, and global for climate change mitigation). Tree species diversity, which we did not consider as an ecosystem service, was chosen because of its cross-cutting and cross-scale nature, as it jointly influences the delivery of goods (e.g. food, raw material, fruit, and timber for local people) and services (e.g. water regulation at the regional scale) [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study strictly complied with Indonesian laws.

Traditionally, the main crop, rice, is cultivated along with other annual crops (such as cassava, maize, etc.) in swiddens from either primary or secondary forest clearing before the plot is abandoned after 1&#x02212;2 years of cultivation. Rubber seedlings and saplings, which are planted in some crop fields during the cultivation phase or just after plot abandonment, eventually lead to rubber-based secondary forests (also called &#x0201c;jungle rubber&#x0201d; gardens) as a result of plant succession. Past and current uses of land by the local community (swidden agriculture system mixed with rubber gardens) and past logging activities have created a mosaic of vegetation reflecting various disturbance types, ages and intensities in the Keluin area.</p><p>We defined seven land-use types in the study area: (1) food crop fields where the main crop, rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.), is planted after using the slash-and-burn method on the initial vegetation (natural forest or secondary vegetation), (2) young secondary regrowth following field abandonment after crops have been cultivated for 1 or 2 years, (3) old secondary regrowth forests further into the process of vegetation succession following field abandonment, (4) young rubber gardens resulting from the planting of rubber seedlings and saplings (<italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic> (Willd. ex A.Juss.) M&#x000fc;ll.Arg.) in some young fallows, (5) old rubber gardens with complex stand structure, (6) logged-over forest that was selectively logged from 1997 to 2005, and (7) natural forest with very little human disturbance.</p><p>Two distinct sets of vegetation and erosion plots were established based on a multi-stratified sampling first across land-use type and second across disturbance age for stands regenerating after slash and burn (see <xref rid="pone.0140423.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). For the purpose of this study, young and old stands (&#x02264; 20 years and &#x0003e; 20 years following disturbance, respectively) were distinguished from each other because stand structure becomes more complex 20 years after initial disturbance [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Plots for the vegetation sampling were scattered across the study area to encompass the variability of topographical situation (ridge, slope, valley bottom) and slope steepness (from flat to very steep) present in this low-elevation hilly landscape. Plots for the erosion protocol were also scattered across the study area, with the additional constraint of having a homogenous slope of ca. 40% (ca. 22&#x000b0;). We chose relatively steep slopes (compared with the standard slope, i.e. 9%, of a typical erosion monitoring method such as the Wischmeier plot [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), as erosion hardly occurs on non-bare slopes of low steepness in the study region [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Vegetation plots: estimating aboveground carbon stocks and tree species diversity</title><p>For young and old stands in both secondary regrowth areas and rubber gardens, 12 plots each of 20 &#x000d7; 20 m were randomly selected (for a total surveyed area of 0.48 ha for each of the four land-use types) to capture the variability of vegetation structure and composition within each land-use type (<xref rid="pone.0140423.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0140423.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). For natural and logged-over forests, we surveyed a total area ca. twice as large as that of secondary regrowth areas and rubber gardens to encompass an even much higher variability of vegetation structure and composition: five rectangular plots each of 20 &#x000d7; 100 m (longer dimension along the contour line; 1 ha each forest type) were selected. Plots were contiguous but staggered down the slope for natural forest (all fitting in a 100 &#x000d7; 400 m area). For logged-over forest, they were scattered on either side of a former logging road built on a ridge, ca. 20 m downslope from the road.</p><p>All trees with diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.3 m) &#x02265; 5 cm were measured, tagged and mapped, and their height estimated, following standard procedures [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Leaf samples were collected at least once for each vernacular name (consistently given by the same group of highly knowledgeable local people using the Iban language) for both young and old secondary regrowth areas and rubber gardens, and for every individual tree for natural and logged-over forests. Identification of the herbarium vouchers were carried out at the Herbarium Bogoriense in Bogor, Indonesia.</p><p>We used three different indices to characterize tree species diversity at the plot level: species richness, Berger&#x02013;Parker index, and Fisher's &#x003b1;. Species richness is the simplest measure of species diversity but does not take into account community evenness. Conversely, the Berger&#x02013;Parker index (defined as the inverse of the proportion of individuals of the most common species in the community) depends only on evenness, and is sensitive to the dominance of a few species. Fisher's &#x003b1; is mathematically unrelated to the first two indices, is relatively independent of sample size, and is insensitive to the presence of rare species [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>We used the generic Chave et al. allometric equation for tropical forests [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] to calculate tree dry biomass. Wood specific gravity, a multiplier included in the aforementioned equation, was obtained from the Global Wood Density Database [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. When species were not found in the database, the genus-level average wood density was used instead. Aboveground biomass (AGB) was split into four fractions (according to tree DBH; 5&#x02013;10 cm, 10&#x02013;30 cm, 30&#x02013;50 cm, and &#x0003e; 50 cm) of which relative proportions were computed with no other analytical purpose than to identify the lowest and highest contributing fractions to total aboveground carbon stocks. Those were calculated from biomass values by application of the standard 0.47 conversion factor [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Because of differences in sampling design (inter-plot distance ranged from 20 to 4650 m), we could not use tree diversity values aggregated over the total surveyed area (0.48 ha each for secondary regrowth areas and rubber gardens, 1 ha each for natural and logged-over forest) to compare the different land-use types (see <xref rid="pone.0140423.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).

Using Spearman's rank-order correlation, we tested for correlations between plot distance in the field and in the NMDS plot to assess to what extent spatial autocorrelation influenced results from the NMDS analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec008"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Tree species diversity and composition</title><p>The three species diversity indices were highest in natural forests (<xref rid="pone.0140423.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

This might in part be due to the fact that cocoa agroforests in their study region are obtained through gradual thinning of the natural forest with minimum impact on the root system [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], while transitions related to practices in our study area (logging, slash and burn) are more abrupt and therefore potentially more disturbing for topsoil.</p><p>Regarding soil erosion control, even if soil loss was lowest in natural forests and differed significantly between some pairs of land-use types, low absolute values of annual soil loss (2&#x02212;3 orders of magnitude lower than the tolerable soil erosion rate [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]) suggest that the service of soil erosion control is delivered as long as soils are protected by vegetation cover, as exemplified in a review for the humid tropics [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, it cannot be asserted that soil erosion is consistently negligible across the landscape and throughout time. We did not monitor soil loss on bare soil elements created by logging activities (e.g. dirt roads, landslides) or related to rubber tapping (e.g. walking tracks) that are known to contribute to erosion at the landscape scale disproportionately compared to their geographically restricted areas [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Nor did we monitor soil loss immediately after a major disturbance (e.g. burning or opening of logging tracks). Since extreme rainfall events that occur while soil is temporarily bare can lead to dramatic soil loss, soil loss monitoring before, during and after disturbance is required to follow soil erosion control during land-use change [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>Our results on tree species diversity show that some areas of human-modified land-use types host high tree species richness (e.g. logged-over forests and old secondary regrowth forest).

Schemes and financial mechanisms in this area that conserve one of these services (e.g. carbon with REDD+, a financial mechanism aiming at Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) would synergistically benefit the others, therefore increasing the effectiveness of natural forest protection.

With the noticeable exception of tree species richness and tree species composition, our data did not show significant differences in service production between logged-over forests, old rubber gardens and old secondary regrowth forests. Tree species richness is high in logged-over forests (one plot can simultaneously host a mixture of old growth and secondary species), but in such forests, aboveground carbon stocks are low. In contrast, aboveground carbon stocks can be large in some old rubber gardens and secondary regrowth forests, but tree species richness is low. Beyond the diversity of products from these land-use types, there is a complementarity in services produced by such human-modified landscapes.

More striking was no trend for carbon storage in topsoil and the slow recovery of different ecosystem services, either in old rubber gardens or secondary regrowth forests. Mean time since last disturbance for our old secondary regrowth forest plots was 47 years, and yet species richness was still significantly lower than for natural forests. Similarly, we found low similarity in tree species composition between old secondary regrowth forest and natural forest plots.</p><p>From a meta-analysis of the recovery of plant biodiversity and carbon stocks in secondary forests, 50 years are enough for species richness to reach natural forest levels, but with only a very low proportion of native forest species (mean value: 26%), even in old stands [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The aboveground carbon stocks we found in old secondary regrowth forests (ca. half those of natural forests) are consistent with the literature but lay in the lower part of the range compiled by the meta-analysis that reports aboveground carbon stock of 50&#x02013;70% pre-disturbance levels after ca. 50 years of forest recovery [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

Another study estimated that 40&#x02212;50 years are needed for secondary forest soil carbon stocks to reach pre-disturbance levels [<xref rid="pone.0140423.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].

The capacity of soils to recover carbon content after disturbances might also be reduced in plots where numerous rotations have already been done. The whole swidden agriculture system is sustainable if the condition that sufficient time is allowed for soil and vegetation to recover is met.

Natural and logged-over forests should be maintained or managed as an integral part of the swidden system, and landscape multifunctionality should be sustained as a safety net against the price volatility of traded goods (e.g. rubber, palm oil, timber, tengkawang oil), upon which the economy of monocrop systems is much more dependent.</p><p>Because of the congruence of services in natural forest, protection of their carbon stocks, for example through financial mechanisms such as REDD+, will synergistically benefit biodiversity and a wide range of other services provided to communities in this area.

As rotation length appears to be a key factor in the sustainability of swidden systems, it is critical to understand the socio-cultural and economic drivers of the reduction in rotation length and the potential feedback of this reduction on social&#x02013;ecological systems.
