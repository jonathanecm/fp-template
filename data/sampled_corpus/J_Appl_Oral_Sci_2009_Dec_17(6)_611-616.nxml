In order to meet this demand, many studies have been developed about dental bleaching and its effects on dental structure. Nightguard vital bleaching introduced by Haywood and Heymann<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> (1989) represents an efficient and safe method that has been the most commonly used bleaching treatment in the last decades. Modifications, improvements and variations of the technique, such as different concentrations of carbamide peroxide agents (10 to 22%) with carbopol and hydrogen peroxide agents were developed.</p><p>Studies have evaluated the effect of carbamide peroxide used in the home bleaching technique (with trays) on the superficial micromorphology of dental structure in regimens lasting longer than an 1 h. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) analyses have shown changes in surface micromorphology of enamel<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> such as the presence of erosions and porosity. However, no study has reported how enamel microhardness and micromorphology are presented at the end of a bleaching regimen of 1 h/day application during 21 days, as recommended by manufacturers of bleaching products with different compositions: carbamide or hydrogen peroxide agents.</p><p>Changes in organic and inorganic content after bleaching treatment may be evaluated by microhardness tests<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.

The teeth were debrided with scalpel blades and periodontal curettes. A transversal section was made, dividing the root and coronal portions. Longitudinal sections were made using double-faced diamond disks to obtain enamel slabs measuring 3 mm x 3 mm.</p><p>Thirty dental enamel slabs were used, with a standardized area of 9 mm<sup>2</sup> (3 mm x 3 mm). The slabs were examined with a stereomicroscope at x10 magnification in order to exclude those with cracks and stains. The slabs were embedded in polystyrene resin by using 2.0-cm-diameter PVC molds, leaving the external enamel surfaces uncovered by the resin. After 24 h, the slabs were removed from the molds and flattened to obtain the smooth surfaces required for microhardness tests. The enamel slabs were ground wet in a mechanical grinding machine with aluminum oxide discs of sequentially decreasing granulation (400-, 600- and 1200- grit) and polished with 6, 3, &#x000bd; and &#x000bc; mm diamond pastes and felt discs under mineral oil cooling, in order to obtain flat, smooth surfaces. Between disc granulations and pastes, the specimens were ultrasonically cleaned by placing specimens in distilled deionized water for a 10-min period to eliminate debris. The 30 enamel slabs were randomly assigned to 3 bleaching agent groups (n=10) and were kept in a humid environment for 1 day until the beginning of the bleaching regimens.</p><p>The bleaching agents are specified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>. The active principle in Colgate Platinum (Colgate-Palmolive Ind. e Com. Ltda., S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil) is 10% carbamide peroxide, and Day White 2Z (Discus Dental, Culver City, CA, USA) contains 7.5% hydrogen peroxide. The manufacturers recommend product application for 1 h/day.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><title>Basic composition and manufacturer of each bleaching agent</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1678-7757-jaos-17-06-0611-gf01"/></fig><p>Prior to the application of the bleaching agents, an individual mold was made for each specimen, using 0.4-mm-thick flexible polymer in a vacuum plasticizer, and the enamel and dentin slabs were subjected to microhardness tests to obtain baseline values. Acalibrated syringe was used to place 0.02 mL of each bleaching agent on the enamel slabs. The individual mold was positioned onto each specimen, and all specimens were then immersed in 13.5 mL of artificial saliva solution (pH=7.0) in individual containers. These containers were closed and kept in a humid environment for 1-h/day. The individual molds were then removed and washed with distilled deionized water. The bleaching agents were removed from the dental slabs by washing with distilled deionized water, and using a soft toothbrush to gently make 5 back-and-forth movements over the specimens, without causing changes on the enamel surface.</p><p>During the remaining 23 h of the day, the slabs of the experimental groups were stored at 37&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C in individual closed receptacles containing 13.5 mL of artificial saliva, which was changed every 2 days. The artificial saliva used in this study was the remineralizing solution described by Featherstone, et al.<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and modified by Serra and Cury<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. The slabs in the control group were also maintained under these conditions, during the whole experiment.</p><p>The bleaching treatment was carried out during 21 days, corresponding clinically to a dental bleaching period of 3 weeks. After the bleaching treatment, the slabs were kept in their individual containers immersed in 13.5 mL of artificial saliva at 37&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C, which was again changed every 2 days, for a further period of 14 days to evaluate the posttreatment period and a possible remineralizing effect of this saliva solution on dental tissue microhardness.</p><p>Microhardness measurements were performed before the bleaching treatment (baseline), 21 days after the beginning of the treatment phase, and in the posttreatment phase (that is, 14 days after completion of the treatment and 35 days from the beginning of treatment).</p><p>Three microhardness indentations were performed in each slab for each time, and assessed quantitatively in Knoop Hardness Number (KHN) with a 25-g load applied during 5 s for each indentation.</p><p>For the SEM analysis, specimens were mounted on metallic stubs and sputter-coated with a 10-nm thick layer of gold. Observations were made under a high resolution field emission in-lens scanning electron microscope (DSM 940 A, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with a digital steady-screen image with a resolution of 1,280x1,024 pixels and *1,500 magnification. The most central region or the region that was most representative of the entire surface after exploratory observation of the area was used. The SEM micrographs were examined by 3 calibrated examiners, who determined the type of surface presented by means of scores according to the presence of erosions on the enamel surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). The sequence of images was evaluated at two distinct periods to assess the intraexaminer agreement. ANOVA and Tukey's test were used to evaluate mean significance of microhardness for each bleaching agent at different time intervals. The statistical analysis was performed using the SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><title>Scores attributed by the examiners, according to the type of surface</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1678-7757-jaos-17-06-0611-gf02"/></fig><p>In the analysis of surface micromorphology, Kappa statistics was applied to assess the intra and interexaminer agreement. For statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test, the mode of visual analysis by 3 examiners in two evaluations was used to establish whether or not there were changes in enamel surface micromorphology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>

The clinical protocol demands the use of a bleaching product in an individual tray for about 2 to 6 weeks<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. However, modifications of the technique have been introduced, such as different concentrations of carbamide peroxide (10% to 22%), as well as 5.5% to 7.5% hydrogen peroxide, with the aim of speeding up the dental bleaching time. Thus, the original protocol of vital tooth bleaching, which involves the direct contact of a bleaching agent with the surface of dental structures for an extended period of time (about 8 h during 6 weeks), has been replaced by faster protocols that demand their use for 1 to 4 h daily, for 1-12 continuous weeks, depending on the desired level of bleaching<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. This shorter exposure time is possible due to the increase in the amount of active substance of the bleaching agent in contact with enamel surface in the first hour of application. The degradation of approximately 30 to 40% carbamide peroxide and hydrogen peroxide<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> occurred in the first 4 h of agent application<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> releases free radicals that break carbon rings of high molecular weight into smaller and clearer molecules<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Moreover, no alterations in microhardness and surface micromorphology have been reported in enamel subjected to a shorter period of exposure to home-use bleaching agents. It is suggested that changes might be minimal or inexistent due to a shorter time of contact between agents and dental structures.</p><p>Studies evaluated the effects of home-use bleaching agents in the original protocol, on the surface micromorphology of dental structure. SEM analysis showed changes in enamel<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> such as the presence of erosions and porosities that could be justified by an extended time of contact between bleaching agents and the dental structure. Moreover, G&#x000fc;rgan, et al.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> (1997) reported changes in surface micromorphology of enamel compared to the control group, which could promote the appearance of erosions and porosities in the dental surface.</p><p>The presence of erosions and porosities in enamel has been related to the byproducts, mainly urea and oxygen, from the oxidizing reaction of bleaching agents<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Urea has the property of denaturing proteins present in organic portions of dental structure, with the potential to penetrate through enamel and affect not only the surface, but also interprismatic portion of enamel<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Therefore, the penetration of urea may contribute to the increase of enamel permeability and microstructural alterations.</p><p>In addition to urea, Hegedus, et al.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> (1999) reported that the oxygen released from carbamide peroxide decomposition is also capable of increasing the porosity of the dental surface, mainly of dentin. The free radicals of oxygen are not specific and may react with organic structures of dental tissues, in which they roam more freely than in mineralized structures. From this aspect, it is important to have in mind that stains on tooth surface are organic composites that degrade by the action of oxygen.</p><p>Alterations in the mineral content of enamel and dentin might occur due to the acid properties of these materials and their components<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Such alterations may be evaluated by microhardness tests<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, as performed in the present study. It was observed that the microhardness of human dental enamel subjected to bleaching agents containing 10% carbamide peroxide or 7.5% hydrogen peroxide remained constant after 21 days of treatment. This behavior may be attributed to the presence of the artificial saliva as the immersion medium that was capable of maintaining the balance between the demineralization and remineralization processes<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> during the bleaching treatment. Moreover, after 1 h, the bleaching agent was brushed off from dental surface, removing any product residues from contact with enamel after treatment. An increase in the microhardness of enamel subjected to different bleaching agents was also observed, and the same occurred with the control group that remained immersed in artificial saliva during the whole experiment. This was observed in the posttreatment phase due to the remineralizing effect of artificial saliva.</p><p>Nevertheless, the surface micromorphology of enamel may be compromised with the use of 10% carbamide peroxide or 7.5% hydrogen peroxide bleaching agents. Although such alterations are not clinically noticeable<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, it is difficult to determine whether they are microscopically reversible. It is considered that the constant use of fluorides<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, adoption of adequate measures of oral hygiene, and particularly saliva, may increase microhardness of dental enamel during and after bleaching. These measures also improve surface micromorphological characteristics of dental structures through the deposition of calcium fluoride crystals, in addition to maintaining the balance between the phenomena of demineralization and remineralization. The combination of these factors perpetuates dental rigidity and prevents clinically visible alterations that may change the dental structure subjected to dental bleaching.</p></sec><sec
