"","f","0","2000","It is not the same to visit Orlando that to live there. In 2000, Florinda was married in Caracas in a family with four children. The couple had a ceramic distribution company and a small restaurant of typical Venezuelan food in El Paraíso. The restaurant opened it because with the construction stoppage, the ceramic company was no longer well. The family used to come to Orlando, Florida every year to visit the parks. And they spent $ 10,000 in 15 days. He loved that vacation there, so when he divorced and decided to emigrate with his children, he chose that city. He went on a student visa but had intentions to stay. I was then 39 years old. Her children were 13 the eldest, nine the second, and the eight-year-old brunette. She did not speak English and came to Orlando to create her new life, which would give her a long and tortuous history. He had $ 25,000 deposited in an American bank. But he had many problems renting a cheap apartment. As Florinda had no credit history and also came with four minor children, people refused to rent him. He spent a month with his children living in a very cheap hotel until he got a very expensive apartment, for a year in rent. Florinda studied English and to keep working in a restaurant. He also cleaned houses. ""Sometimes I had to climb on the roofs to clean, I had to do everything, while my children were alone in the apartment,"" he recalls. ""The elder took care of the other three and cooked it, and I feared that they would realize that my children were alone. She was sold a car in very poor condition. She complained about herself for the things that happened to her, but she understood that it was hard learning that cost her a lot of money and effort. Florinda says that in 2001 the family ate what they could, saving up to the last penny. On weekends, they went out to stay in the malls to avoid spending energy inside the apartment. Life in Orlando for kids was totally against the Disney World they had enjoyed years ago. They had to get used to it. ""I took my kids to the malls, told them to grab whatever they wanted and imagine they already bought it, they put it on, they already used it and they threw it in. And there we left the cart full of things that My children had chosen so we survived not to get so depressed. We could not buy anything at all. My ex-husband did not contribute at all, he called my children two or three times only during those two years."" Florinda cried at night when she came home from work. ""If I look back, I do not know how I did it, I started my work at 5:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. I would stop and do all day food. I was afraid that my children would get into the kitchen There were strict rules at home, they could not cook, they could not go out, nor open the door for anyone, they could not answer the phone, it was like a war field. He would guide me and tell me where to get in. I had to learn and get ahead. "" ""Why then did you not return to Venezuela?"", I asked. ""I was very stubborn, I had set out to learn English and my children had a career and I was not going to throw myself back, going to Venezuela, I wanted to be very far from where my ex-husband was. My kids who almost did not have money and that we could go back They worried a lot and they told me 'do not do that', they asked me to do something to stay in Orlando They heard bad things about Chavez on TV and they did not want to be in Venezuela."" She had $ 6,000 left in an account and Florinda said she had to do something. I was already cleaning and cooking at night sometimes until one in the morning. I could not. I look for information. He had studied medicine in Merida for four years. He did not graduate because he married. I knew Anatomy, Microbiology and the terms of medicine. That helped him to study in a school of therapeutic massages. ""They charged me $ 6,000, the last thing I had left in the account, I was charged as an international student, very expensive. I was a year in that."" He initially had a student visa. He then obtained a tourist visa for six months, which he renewed until the end of the year. It launched to look for what all the immigrants crave: a permanent resident visa. She paid eight thousand dollars to a Venezuelan lawyer who took her along the way of an investor visa she knew was not good for her, because she did not qualify, she did not have as much money as the visa required. He did all the documentation, collected the eight thousand dollars and a year nothing. The second year he paid five thousand dollars to another lawyer and it did not do him any good. He had already lost his legal immigration status and I almost had no money. ""I was unlawful for three months and I had to marry a man I had met 15 days before in December 2001. When I met my American husband, I was graduating as a masseuse, I got married because he came into my life and introduced me Like an angel. At that moment, I was alone and depressed, it was a very easy fish to fish. The first four months were honeymoon, it was very cute and precious, I said to myself: 'My God, I got this man with A four-room house where my children fit perfectly. ""We moved in. I thought he was going to protect me, but it did not happen that way. It turned out that what he wanted was to have me out of a whirl and help him pay the bills. There was domestic, psychological and finally physical violence. ""Florinda said that she had very ugly things in her second marriage. The guy was kind of crazy. He left dirty things on purpose and filled the bathroom with shit for her to clean. Once there was a hurricane threat, and it occurred to him to create an atmosphere of much terror; While the other members of the family panicked because they did not know what a hurricane meant, he devoted himself to protecting the dog from the house and letting his children know that the dog cared more than they did. He once told Florinda that blacks were ""a pile of crap"" and that Latinos were worse. This man did not allow Spanish to be spoken in his home, or Spanish music could be heard, or Spanish TV channels or anything else related to the native language of the other members of the family. ""Every day I had to Fight to win the battle and every time I went to work I was worried that I would leave my daughters alone there with that guy who was bad in the head. It was like Chinese torture. We suffered 4 years being with him until finally I When we were summoned to the second Immigration interview, he threatened me that he would not go and in the end, he did not come, but the Immigration judge called him and told him to go, that was his obligation, that how Was going to do that to a woman with four children. I had shown the judge the complaint to the authorities about physical violence suffered at the hands of that individual. And the same immigration judge told me later 'now you divorce this man only ""She was very human with me when I explained the situation to her."" She was not able to leave the country during the years when the visa was being processed. ""I did not have money at the time to go to Venezuela, I lost my father in the first year and I could not go to Venezuela, I was in the immigration process, I could not go back. Spent everything I had in her heart disease. There were things that moved the floor completely, which completely changed my life. ""Florinda divorced a second time. She had had very bad experiences in her second marriage but at least she was legal resident in the USA for herself and her children. He had to keep working. It was in 2006 when he could return to visit Venezuela. He did it to sell his Vista Alegre house that had been left over from his first marriage. With that sale, he was saying goodbye to Venezuela. She could no longer return even if she thought of it, because she would have nothing, no house to sleep with her children, and she would not come under the wing of her ex-husband. With the sale of her six-room house, she made a lot of money. Control of changes in Venezuela had already been implemented. It lost about 25 percent of the dollar exchange sale and took Orlando 150 thousand dollars. That was two years before the real estate crisis in the USA, which drastically lowered the price of houses and apartments. ""I bought a house at the worst price, when I was at the top of the economy, not knowing what the thing was like, I did not do what I used to do in Venezuela: to pay my bills early. I put 150 thousand dollars that I brought from Venezuela. At those times the massages were flourishing and I was working from seven in the morning until 12 at night. I worked to keep me until the economy went to the floor. I got sick with cancer When I returned to work they started to take me out, they made my life impossible, I imagine that they thought that the illness I had had prevented me from going and doing the job well. I had to leave and I was out of work Just when the recession came. ""Florinda paid two thousand dollars a month for the house in Orlando and, as happened to many people, and the house does not have the value she is paying. ""At the moment I am losing it, I have six months without being able to pay it, doing massages but it does not give to pay the house monthly, I look for work without being able. Let's go live. What are we going to do to get work and keep fighting? I'm still alive, I have not gotten all the blood ""(she smiles). She continues to work for a cleaning company, she looks for particular cleaning jobs for offices and houses, and hired them for it. It is no longer worth keeping your house because it costs too much and they do not want to lower your price. ""It is not good business, I have to get rid of it. That's life. ""His 25-year-old son graduated as a mechanic, but he does not make a big dent right now, but he plans to set up his own business with a partner. He is selling car parts and help in what he can. His second son He has been very pleased with his work in a company that makes helicopters and bombs, designs war-related tools, studies to become a mechanical engineer and graduates in December 2012. He was a champion in a type of wrestling. La Emigration to Florinda has been a very hard and expensive learning. ""There are many things. You must be too strong to withstand physical, material and spiritual losses. We Venezuelans have no idea what it is to be an immigrant; We lose the family, the uncles, the grandparents that are so important for the children. I paid dearly for my presence here. ""She says she has seen her Venezuelan friends in Orlando in very difficult situations as well. A woman who is now with no money, only 100 dollars, the car was spoiled and thrown The house where he lived. ""My children and I,"" he says, ""have achieved something: we are citizens. We are better and we survive, but it gives me pain. A couple of computer engineers with two little kids are calling me to give them cleaning jobs because they're peeling, they have nothing. ""I asked him what he felt about his future in the United States."" My children have already taken root in this country. I already had the worst, I already learned English, I already became (North) American. I feel Venezuela as my own country, I love it, I love it, but when I go there I feel out of place and when I'm here because the (North) Americans see me as a Latina. One remains as in the air. But that is something that I had to live so my children have a better future. It cost me a lot alone with four guys. Hopefully they know how to take advantage and hopefully this country will give them the opportunity that I did not have. I'm not going to leave and leave them alone, I need to be here for my children to have family and Venezuela go on vacation. My future is this: to see my children and they have a better opportunity than mine.”"
"1","m",1,1997,"Only four interviewees in my research used the phrase ""American Dream"" as an example of living or living it. One of them was Javier José Castellano, thoroughbred rider. By December 2011 had already produced that year more than 15 million dollars in prizes in racecourses of the USA and was classified of third in the national statistics of winners of money, according to the page of the Racing Daily Form. Castellano was not the statistical champion in 2011. It was Ramón A. Dominguez, another Venezuelan who won more than 20 million dollars and won the annual Eclipse Award as the best rider. Castellano arrived in July 1997, is going to turn 15 in the USA. Since beginning that year, as a straightforward and unknown apprentice, has produced more than 140 million dollars in American equestrianism, according to the specialized page www. Equibase.com12. Being apprentices, in their beginnings the jockeys discharge kilos to their jackets, and this is a rule that is made to make them competitive in front of the professionals. The coaches watch the good young rookies who get to the middle, no matter if they are foreigners. They are asked to mount their specimens and decrease their legal weight to compete in better condition with the other purebloods. The first year JJ Castellano won 83 races and produced more than one million dollars. Jockeys usually earn 10 percent of the stock, although there are cases where they remember that they will only earn a salary, that is only in very special cases. ""I came to do a sports race here. I started in Miami, Calder Racecourse, after 3 1/2 years I moved to New York, I'm ten years old there."" He has also assembled in Dubai, Japan, and Hong Kong. ""I came because I was looking for a better future, although I did not really need it because I was in third place in the statistics of the Venezuelan equestrian sport, I was winning a lot of races and had a well-known name in Venezuela. Hopes, the illusions were to ride in North American racetracks because the horse riding here is more developed. There are better horses. I always had that longing."" The jump from Castellano to the North American horseback riding came when he won a classic in Venezuela with the Dorian. ""Two days later I heard that they were taking him to Miami, so I talked to the owner, I asked him if it was true that he was taking it and he confirmed it to me."" Then he said: ""Even if it's for once, I want to go ride that horse, if the horse stays, I'll go back to Venezuela. That way I'll feel the satisfaction as a riding professional in the United States."" JJ says that he then replied that he would help him. ""I gave him my papers, I took out my visa, and he managed a work visa with Carlos Morales, a famous Venezuelan coach here."" The story of Javier José is as if destiny had set a trap, a stump or just put it to the test to enjoy a delicacy to which only those who demonstrate temper. And patience. He, like almost all the emigrants, had initial problems for the adaptation to the new means. ""When I got here, it was a month and a half, and nothing happened, I went to an immigration lawyer's house, and I got a work visa, and then it was a month and a half and I had to wait until my papers came out During that month and a half I was not doing anything, it was not producing, it was not working, and I knew it beforehand, but always one is altered when it lives in the moment. I was only 18 years old. He told me that he did not need to be here, what he could do here in Venezuela, he did not need to be here to stand. But I held out, and the papers arrived. At first, everything was hard. It cost me a lot. It was in Miami in 1997. Then I stayed here in the United States. I was given a work visa for three years. He did not speak any English, but absolutely nothing. There were some Venezuelans we met; we made the atmosphere. Communication with American trainers was sometimes complicated to know how to run the horse. The food is very different from the one styles, everything, an 180-degree change. The first few months I suffered, and one cries for the bad times. The first day of work I won two races, the second day I won three races, the third day everything went well, the week I won a classic, things went very well, thank God, even, as the saying goes, I entered with The right foot to the North American equestrian. They gave me only three months of training, I won enough races, and I skipped the professional, and I kept winning races. I unloaded weight before as an apprentice, five pounds in front of the other professionals, it was an advantage for me to break through the environment and drive horses with opportunities. Then I became professional."" Javier José Castellano has had many successes. He won in 2004 one of the most important prizes of the United States, the Breeder's Cup Classic Gr I, that runs once a year with the prize of five million dollars. He obtained the second rung of the triple crown, the Preakness Stakes Gr I in 2006. It was made in August of 2 011 with the classic of the summer with a million dollars in prizes. He has also triumphed three times at Travers Gr I in Saratoga; he is the only active jockey who has achieved that. He has won statistics and is close to three thousand races won in the United States, and in 2007 he won the International Dubay Golden Sachin race. Gr I. It is common for the specialized press of the United States and Venezuela to talk about their successes and career achievements. ""Today I love life here. It is very energetic the equestrian of New York, one of the best of equestrianism. It is sacrificed, you have to travel a lot, and it is very competitive. I have time that I do not go to Venezuela. I brought myself to my grandparents died, I have my aunts there, but I have not been to Venezuela for nine years, I have nephews and cousins ​​in Venezuela, but my mother lives in Miami. I have a family, I have a wife, and all of this is part of my life, I realize my American dream."" Learning the language helped him gain concentration to get into the middle. ""I already speak perfect English. If you knew that I do not feel nostalgia for my country, unfortunately, I have had many gaps and a bit of disappointment from Venezuela. It is one of the richest countries in Latin America and unfortunately it is decomposed. The insecurity is incredible, there are Fear, it's totally different Because of the insecurity you can not go to Venezuela because they kidnap you, they want to kill you I've suffered crime in Venezuela My father was killed to steal a car I'm completely disappointed in Venezuela It's my I love him very much, but I have enough emptiness. Of Venezuela, really. My decision to emigrate was one of the best I've ever taken, thank God."" The following month of the interview with Castellano I saw one of his races, and I was able to understand why he is among the most money winners of the USA horseback riding. It was the Garden City Stakes, run at Belmont Park. With just 200 meters left, his lead -Winter Memories- was the last in the squad of eight. It was in a very compromised central position; there was nowhere to go. The youtube.com video shows clearly how Castellano decided to get up and then cross to the right - looking outside - and he got it. Began to brace-strong. ""I want to go to Miami to ride that horse."" And repeated-advancing safely. The goal was close when he came to dominate Theyskens Theory. Then he did not brace as if he knew it was no longer necessary. It took to the exemplary content the last meters, winning by half body. The bag was 250 thousand dollars."
"2","f",0,1998,"The story of Luisa, husband, and children in Atlanta, Georgia, began with drama in Venezuela in 1998. It was not politics, economics or personal insecurity that drove her north. It was a family affair, something that always stood in his marriage: his mother-in-law. She constantly engaged in raising her four- and two-year-old children, and made noise in the five-year relationship with her husband. Until one day the mother-in-law assaulted her physically. He was hanging her and caused a severe concussion in the neck and fissure in a vertebra. That took her to the hospital. When she then wanted the divorce, her husband proposed to go both to the United States. They lived in the urbanization San Fernando 2000, of the Apure state. From there is her husband, an employee of the telephone company CANTV, where she made a promising career as a coach. So, he took out his visa and went first with some friends. All would work selling pots for an Atlanta company. ""I was alone with my two children, and the months passed. I recovered and went to Caracas to get the visa, and I was denied. For me that was devastating. I could not come. But life went on. I got my husband's clearance; I went to Margarita Island where my family is. I was there for a few months with my mom. My sister took care of the children, and I went to work with one of my sisters who had a business. I was then 27 years old. Now I have 42."" Luisa is from Margarita, from La Mira, next to Playa el Agua. There he spent several months selling things to tourists. I had to plan the trip to the United States. She was willing to travel without a visa if her husband helped her from Atlanta. ""I would say, either you come, or I go. But he assured me that he would not return."" He then told me that the only solution was for me to go to Mexico. And I did not know what to do; I did not know what to do, I did not know what to do, I did not know what to do. An adventure without risk, a super cool adventure. I told him then one day that I was going."" Luisa is thrown and took risks. The oldest of his sons had 20 days of surgery when he left with both to Mexico. ""My mother used to say, 'You're crazy, how are you going to go with that child who was recently operated?' But I was determined, the date was set, and the tickets were already bought for Mexico City. I left the children because they were going to rob me. I respond that if my children go down a precipice I go with them. I'm passionate about the children. I had no farewell. No one went to accompany me to the airport. Nobody believed In my ""American dream."" There was a friend who wanted to come in. A friend of my church husband (Adventist) I told him to accompany me to help me with the children. Denis. ""This boy accompanied me the whole trip when we were in Mexico. He had the money to pay the coyote, 15 but he had to spend it to stay a little in Mexico."" While in Mexico, Denis said he had found a Coyote who was going to pass him by himself and leave Luisa alone. The two arrived together in Mexico and took a bus to a city called Reynosa, in the state of Tamaulipas. They spent December all there waiting, spending a lot of money. ""It cost me about $700 a ticket, I left almost all the liquidation of my husband."" When we arrived in Mexico I brought nothing more than 400 dollars in cash, and I had to pay bus tickets to get to the border. I stayed for $200. My husband had to send me the money, but he was not doing well here, I was getting paid to pay the coyote and I did not get it. January 10 is to reach the US."" In Mexico, he had to deal with poverty and lack of comforts. They fought the cold by heating their hands with the gas burners in the kitchen in the houses where they arrived, or sleeping together. ""We were supposed to go through Reynosa, but we did not find a single coyote there who was trustworthy. My husband paid $600 a coyote woman to pick us up, and when he was here in Atlanta, he ended up paying the money, Two thousand dollars. The lady went once and stayed to call me but more never showed up, she cheated the money on my husband. "" Luisa decided to pass through Ciudad Juárez, the Mexican city that is opposite of El Paso, Texas. Denis would go with another coyote from Reynosa, but they also cheated him. ""I brought him with me and my husband would pay for it later. I was not able to let him go. It was very good to take him, because God directed everything. We arrived at the border, to a hotel where several were going to arrive and contact us there. We would be trained on what the issue was, what we should say, what we should not say. They took us to a little house where the other coyotes were, the ones that had the most contact with one. I had diarrhea because of something I had eaten. We got a big package tied up in a league where there were dozens of legal plastic card badges, like identity cards, but from the United States. They gave me many to look for some whose photo would match my face. I say that's a very big mafia. My friend got one with his same face. 'The same monkey,' I said because it's bold. He grabbed her and that was him. The one I took did not look like me. The woman in the photo was hornier. Does not matter. Luisa stayed with a group of Central Americans and a coyote, who decided that Luisa would be the first to go through the bridge because ""she has personality and for her they are paying well."" Her friend She passed by the bridge alone, showing her card. He arrived at a hotel on the other side to wait for the next group. The same coyote would pass to her children. Louis was worried that the major is white and could pass for gringo, He had trained the eldest son to say that his name was little George, who tried to pass the coyote on the bridge at two o'clock in the afternoon and he succeeded. Her special baby chair, they waited for her to come later, and for the tiredness to sleep the child, neither of them asked the coyote for papers, or they stopped their car. His children had already achieved the adventure feat. Once her children were on the US side, she tried to cross the bridge showing the card the coyote had given her the day before. Until that moment, Luisa had thought that everything she had done in Venezuela had been legal. Now it was not like that. Her heart was leaking from her body as she walked to the gate. But he was thinking of meeting his children. He showed the card to the guard, but he did not believe him and ordered him to go inside the checkpoint. There he interrogated her about half an hour. She sustained all the time that she was Mexican and even gave an address in Ciudad Juárez, for which she had been trained. If the immigration officer had discovered that she was Venezuelan, she would have been imprisoned in North American territory, where she would be booked and deported to Caracas. ""I found it thrown"" (the Venezuelans say ""thrown""), Luisa responded to the repeated times when the guard asked where he had taken the card. Finally, the guard said: ""You can throw yourself"" and she did not understand. ""Adventure was related to flatulence."" A ""daughtered devil"" crosses the Mexican border. The man repeated: ""Okay, you can throw yourself."" He realized then that he must return to the Mexican side. Luisa's world collapsed as she walked back to the hotel. I only thought about who would spend the night with their children. ""I arrived at the hotel and they were all there, the coyote and the Central American natives, and they said that they would spend the night at the bridge again. I did not want to be with them, I felt that they would rob me if I was not there. ""I stood up and said, 'If these girls leave, I'll go with them, because I am no better or worse than them, I am like them. If they pass by the river, I pass by the river. ""They left near six o'clock the next day. The group was about ten people, including a coyote and her husband who were subcontracted by the older coyote, just to cross the river. This minor coyote only charged $ 100 for each. ""We put ourselves on the floor looking at the guards when we went away We rubbed our hands cold. It was January. When there was a change of guard we ran. After passing the river there was a large pipe, about 25 meters, no We had to walk very low, not let us see, drag us on the floor. We lowered the first pipe but then played it up, which was easier We had to put our hands in the bush, crawling on the floor so they would not see us. There were agents nearby. After we passed that part, we were filming, we looked like Rambo. Then came the part of the river. There was only one man among We had to take off our clothes. The coyote got his wife on his shoulder and passed. We took off our pants, we hung them above the waist and passed in panties. The level of the river did not reach higher than my waist. Hands up, with shoes and pants. I wore boots that were fashionable then with braids that went up to the calf. The river was frozen, my legs froze, not I felt them. After leaving the river, we had to put our clothes on. I barely did it, pulled them off and put on my boots. We played another part of mount, like 20 minutes, we had to run a lot, quiet, I was the last. I still did not feel my legs. As I practically got to the level of them before, the girls helped me, they grabbed me by one arm and the other by the other. They told me that the coyote wanted to leave me. I could hardly walk. Then we had to cross a second pipe, but this one was already in North American territory. I only had a little water. But look how good and kind God is to me. We were already in an American village, one had to go scattered then, walking quietly. But as one puts on his pants and the blender is wet, then one gets his tail wet (hence the so-called wet ones). Neighbors see him and call Immigration. As I was last, I saw a lady who looked like an angel, behind the patio of his house. He beckoned me out and whistled the whole group. The lady disappeared, but I continued anyway. I entered the corral of the house and I saw it. We walked in one by one, the lady gave me a towel and sat me down. He made us coffee and chocolate, he treated us as if we were his family, he entered the coyote too, he enjoyed my blessing despite his bad actions with me. God was listening to us. The lady told us that one day she had also crossed the river to reach this country, but she already had papers, so she understands and is always looking to see who passes the river and helps her. For me it was a great lesson that will never be forgotten in my life. Then they called a taxi, but they let it pass because the lord of the house offered to take us all if we paid the race. Even the taxi drivers could give us away. The wife's husband took 10 people in a two-door car. You can imagine: some lying where they put their feet, others sitting and others sitting on top. He took us to the hotel where we were going to arrive. There were many people, in a very large room they were cooking, looking and looking. There were neither my children nor my friend, I thought they had been stolen. Mrs. Coyote arrived, the one who negotiated our pass to USA, Lidia, a citizen (North) American, native of Ecuador. He had his mafia. The top high-ranking coyote is the one who takes care of me. A ""daughter diablo"" crosses the Mexican border at the destination in Texas, where my husband was going to pick me up. She had to take care of me at the airport. Lidia had my children in a four-star hotel room. They were waiting for me alongside Denis and a coyote nephew. When my children saw me they kissed me everywhere and told me that they thought they were going to see more. My friend told me that those boys had cried so much for me and they were desperate. I was not able to sleep that much adrenaline that night in the body ""In the hotel there were many people from Central America who waited for the moment to advance. There was still danger, there were other checkpoints. In that place, even though it was already the United States The coyote prepared everything for the next day in the afternoon, when they would take a flight to another border city. ""Luisa noticed the ingenuity of the human being:"" Let's disguise you, ""said the coyote. He handed her his suitcase and passports, bought him a suit of trousers and a jacket, a scarf and high heels, accompanied by a young, handsome and educated guy who went with her to the airport, where he saw another of the illegals of the old hotel but they had told her not to sing a victory until she was able to do it. That the plane took off. There were cases where they were going down from the plane to the illegal ones. ""Pray, I said to my eldest son, from here we can get off."" He has been very fervent since he was a little boy, 'take off, take off', and the plane was delayed. When the plane started, my son exclaimed, 'Mami, we made it.' 'Amen, papito. ""The insertion of Luisa and her children in US society had its ups and downs. Even after a decade they remain illegal. But both have been able to work, earn good money in dollars and acquire their own home. The interview took place in his new home in a typical Afro-descendant neighborhood that he bought for $ 20,000, after losing another because of real estate hiccups in 2008. They make him an investment of over $ 80,000. The house has three levels and is a large extension of land. In that she invests the money that her husband currently earns, who works in installing kitchens, especially outside of Georgia, in the states. The eldest son, who does not have a US visa, sent him to study Theology in Argentina. When Luisa is asked how she will enter US territory again, she responds with confidence: ""You will see how."" To give me this interview, I had to telephone four times with Luisa, who was not very determined. He agreed when he assured her he would not give her last name. He then summoned me to his house. I was waiting for an open, some sort of large balcony adjoining the receipt. The house was empty and with almost everything in remodeling. I liked what I saw when I was asked to go to the interview. I had prepared it for the event. It was completely empty, except for two chairs, diagonally located. So we were talking for two hours. Luisa made a lot of money in Atlanta, selling to Latinos household goods and cooking utensils, like water purifiers. He confessed that he once made 700 dollars in one day. He left with his car and his son in the Latin neighborhoods of Atlanta and made his own sweeps by contacting people who spoke the same language. Every Sunday we sold in the flea market as well. ""We went upstairs, we bought another car, and we still have, we walked all the United States, we lived the"" American Dream ""as you have no idea. In just ten months after I arrived. We would give up to four vacations a year, we would go to Miami, Disney, anywhere to walk with the kids. We always get quality time with the kids. Now I do not work with that company that we I was only interested in having something to eat and my children had a place to live and study. ""From this it follows that Luisa and her family no longer live those times of good resources due to the laws Today a ""daughter"" of the devil ""crosses the Mexican border Georgia, which prevents her from working and driving, or risk being deported if captured. Before I could even drive without a license. It is also more difficult for companies to hire illegals. Her husband was legal for a few months at the beginning. But he has a driver's license and a Social Security number. When he arrived, anyone who applied for a number, and had a visa, gave it to him. He was given it. With that social security number, he has taken out loans to buy houses and buy cars. She does not appear anywhere and has never been interested in being a car or house owner, but she is behind in moving the strings. ""I think that emigrating was the best decision. Thread, it was always a problem. We did not emigrate out of necessity but for a family problem. And I thank God that I could raise my children away from my husband's family. We both studied in private schools here. I have a lot of faith. My husband and I were able to get a divorce, and either of us married a US-born person, but we did not want to do it because it goes against our principles. We have faith, hope and patience for I do not know if it's forbidden to drive, I cannot drive because I can put my dream out the window. But some are driving drunk and these people must pay. I think there must be an immigration settlement. ""In the hospitals, they attend even if they do not give a Social Security number."" One of the good things is that they do not let anyone die here. What does not pay one, us or the insurance, the Government. Then I go, they send me to the address that I give a series of receipts, but I become crazy, let's see when they get me. I used to pay everything. I got to pay more than 15 thousand dollars in hospital care. Every year we pay taxes, every year up to three thousand dollars and when we had the company registered up to five thousand dollars, ""But she would never cross the border as she did."" Having come to Mexico is like going to war. After that I always dream that they chase after me. I have nightmares and I dream that I am crossing the border. I was left with a trauma. ""The adventure of crossing the United States from Ciudad Juárez through El Paso, despite violence in the Mexican city, has remained an option for some Venezuelans. Between 1998 and 2011, Immigration City of El Paso have processed and completed annually between three and thirteen judicial cases against Venezuelans.16 These cases are apart from the nationals who may have been captured and resolved their deportation administratively by the ICE and, of course, all those creoles who managed to crown their Ambition and were able to pass without being detected by the authorities in this border city."

Note that I have not even applied to Cadivi dollars, when I went to the consulate in New York, I had to give the address where I lived and that was traumatic for me. I'm super paranoid ... that's why I'm here. "" Alejandra is a young professional of 36 years that develops in the area of ​​the TV. Today she is divorced from her husband, who was her boyfriend for life, but could not stand the trot that an emigrant has to give in the USA. We spoke on Skype in July 2011. She graduated in 1999 as a graphic designer in Caracas and that same year she went to New York to continue studying. ""I remember perfectly the day my dad gave me the check to come. She said to me, 'Daughter, the day I die, do not wait for me to leave you something, or anything, here is your inheritance.' His boyfriend worked in Houston and with the crisis of his company they decided to move him to Caracas. Although she never thought it good to do that - and she said it - they came to the country in 2002 and they got married. As usual, there was a honeymoon in Paris, but life came back to the in-laws, because they could not get an apartment. They did not have a car, because interest was high. It began a major devaluation that took her husband's salary from the equivalent of $ 2,500 to $ 800. It was at that moment that exchange control was implemented. Alejandra comments on one of the causes of emigration, which I have also heard from other Venezuelans: the shortage. ""During the oil strike, one day I went to the market and did not find toilet paper in the place where my whole life had been bought since I was a child. For that day I said to my husband: 'I can not live in a Country where there is no toilet paper. ""My husband then said, 'Look, I do not want to say I told you so, but I told you.' He gave me the reason."" They decided that she would go away to New York alone, because she was the one who could get a job more easily. ""I spent the first year of marriage living in New York with my cousin, working as a hotelier, with a tourist visa, and I interviewed everyone until I finally got a chance at an agency in Houston. They gave the HI-B visa and my ex-husband gave him an escort visa.With that visa from him, which is cruel, they do not give you permission to work, just permission to be a husband and cook.Then what looked like an adventure ended up being A nightmare. ""Three years passed without him getting a job,"" just killing one tiger ""."" Alejandra worked not only from Monday to Friday, but on weekends she did it in a bar, until four in the morning ""You think things are temporary, but they end up happening years ... That was what motivated the final rupture of the apartment. Relationship, already after several years of trying. He got a job in Los Angeles and we moved there. I left my job in San Diego. I said 'well, I kept you three years, now I'm going to take myself a sabbatical.' By that time she had several health problems, she did not feel well. That is why he traveled to India, where he only devoted himself to meditation until he returned. ""He had his work permit expired in November and I was reminding him from February that he would remember to send the documents to the lawyer to renew the permit.He complained, said that the papers were taken out in six weeks, But as a prophet of disaster, he sent his papers six weeks earlier and did not renew it in time, so that in the office he was told that they could not have him working without permission. They grabbed that and said 'chao fish.' Alejandra also said ""chao pescado."" He continued doing TV commercials and moving forward with yoga. ""Suddenly there was another relationship with an American, and it did not work either, I was disgusted and so I decided to go to New York."" That was in 2009. He had lived three years in New York, three years in Houston, two years in San Diego and three others in New York. "" I have been in the USA for 13 years and I have not solved my stabilization. I do not know if it's out of pride, but I said, 'I'm not getting married to get US residency papers.' I know many who have gotten their papers that way. I also did not want to get the residence when I was working with the company, because I saw many who acquired the papers and ended up as five years working as slaves in the company, they did not raise their salaries, they exploded, they were paranoid all over the country. Day because if they lost the job they lost the visa. I also did not want to live like this ... Finally I won several awards with the advertising agencies I was with and I also won an EMMY (prestigious or US award in the field of TV and video). ""Alejandra says that she introduced the petition when she had won the EMMY, had not yet given it to her, then she was considered only as a nominee. Three years lost, five thousand dollars in lawyers, all the stress. Well, I applied a second time and that's what I'm doing right now. I reckon I've spent $ 30,000 on my Green Card. If in 99 I had married a gringo, I could have invested that money in something else and had my citizenship for years ... maybe I ended up marrying a gringo! ""Now he lives with a work permit."" Years to a travel permit. It lasts four months to apply. It costs $ 800, every 12 months you have to renew it, it only allows you to be 28 days out of the country each time you travel. It is for multiple trips. ""She travels frequently to visit her father in Bogota and she finds herself cleaner, more beautiful and more secure, and gives her more desire to go. Dirty, more insecure. ""It's an interesting phenomenon because I went to Bogota once a year. I know what it was like to go to Bogota in the 80's and watch the news, you did not go to the mall because maybe there was a car bomb and that is not so at all. It is to see the evolution in one society and the decadence in the other. Every time I go to Venezuela I find that a new member of my traditional group of students has emigrated. In Caracas with what he could not live was to open his eyes, turn on Globovision and see what had happened, if Chavez had died or see what had happened in the Plaza Altamira, that political uneasiness every day. Not here, because here you know that Obama is going to be where he is, that from one day to another there can not be a radical change. Here the country on September 10 (2001) and September 12 was the same. But what kind of future was there for a young and talented person like me in Venezuela? I had the experience of putting it into practice as a manager there, with a great position, and even then I could not buy a car or do anything, go to the supermarket or the facilities that I find here. Now, the ""American Dream"" is a chimera. Those of us who have here enough years can know. Everything is based on credit and if the economy gets a slip you can go yourself down. You can not believe in stories, you deserve to have your feet on the ground, you are going to spend work in USA, Caracas or Germany ... The geographic space that one chooses to live depends on a very personal decision. ""Alejandra takes three years Like working independently, something that has been hard because with a film a year is not paid rent in New York. ""I am looking for full time and as it is the economy has not been easy. When I go to the Venezuelan consulate in New York I wear my red flannel, if I do not do tail hours. The concierge already knows me ... You have to know how to adapt to the situation ... It's like putting on your heels when you get EMMY. I feel like an ally, because I am neither here nor there. I do not identify with the (North) American culture, but this is where I decided to live and every time I go to Venezuela I feel more touristy, I feel less Venezuelan, although I am born and raised in Venezuela. ""The conversation ends with a lament of Alejandra about the uncertainty of the answer they will give her about her Green Card. If they say no, everything will have fallen and must start again."

From the point of view of his work, he was quite dynamic; He had to travel all over Latin America frequently. His position at IBM was excellent, which helped him quite a bit to get a transfer abroad. ""Our social life, work or events, was very active, we had fun.Then began the subject of insecurity and forced us to restrict ourselves.I did not want to box in my house.On the other hand, I began to envisage the future for my children, And I did not see it clearly.Then we made the decision to look for something abroad, and I got it in several countries.

They currently live in Aurora, 25 minutes from Toronto. The headquarters is 15 minutes by car. Rafael chose it because it is cheaper than living in the city of Toronto itself. The family has been living there since 2007. He paid for the transfer. ""That was one of the benefits I offered to the company that wanted to take me."" Many companies claim that they do not have funds for the relocation, I assure them that I was running with that, we arrived with enough dollars to settle in. If you come with a few savings, You get out of it in three months, but you have to put up with it for at least a year.I spent all my life in dollars, and after I had got married we were still in that plan, so we had enough funds to keep us.At the beginning, we had to pay for many things Because here they do not give credit to one and we all had to pay it in cash "". The great concern of his wife and children was the language. ""As we were thinking about that, my children were studying in a bilingual school, I always spoke to them in English, and my wife spoke to them in both languages ​​so they could grow up with both of them. My wife and I have few friends, but good ones.In these four years, we have met a lot of Venezuelans.Have a relationship here with a Venezuelan Sometimes it becomes difficult because they get used to this environment, many families stay in their houses, go out only from time to time and do not go around visiting others constantly, as in Venezuela.

He feels rather nostalgic, however. Almost the whole family is still in Venezuela. ""If you open a door for a woman, she gets upset, and if she's in a car, she's going to have to wait for you. The bus stops to give the place to a lady; they do not insult you with the joke. A one goes to the games of Major Leagues, but they are so annoying that it misses a Caracas-Magellan.And likewise, there are things that I do not miss. Here at 11 pm and my wife or children go out and nothing happens to them.I go to a hospital, and they take care of me without charging me anything.There is always a good attention, and the supplies are not lacking.The schools cost nothing and are good, They give their books to my children, and they are tremendous buildings.I do not want to walk on a road and fall into a hole.If there is one here, you call, and then they cover it.No discrimination.You can be in a commercial center in Canada And listen to speak in five and six languages ​​in a small space. Here you get Indians, Muslims, Arabs, Canadians, all in one place. "" He has never closed the idea of ​​returning. It will be decided once the boys graduate.

""It gave them service in automation of plants and facilities."" Adolfo's labor problems coincided with a fortuitous reunion with a much-loved girlfriend three decades ago. ""The meeting was a month before the strike; it was fatal love again."" She is American, Adolfo had met her in Miami.

He demonstrated this in Caracas, where he lived until March 2002, when political and personal insecurity incidents caused him to abandon his house in the Altamira urbanization abruptly. He had a design company and also worked with his brother in the import business. He was doing well with his business. She had known who her husband would be in the company where she worked with her brother-in-law and had decided to marry her and leave for the United States in August 2002. ""But I had many incidents, particularly two that were decisive, I was kidnapped, They finally got scared and let me go.I had to negotiate with them my car, and finally, I received it, of course, robbed. "" The second incident was mild political violence. Ángela María says it this way: ""In February of 2002 people came from the hills, all dressed in black in a protest.It was where the bomb of Los Palos Grandes, by the Luis Roche Avenue.I went to my house and my I was on the side of the opposition, and they were from the government, they grabbed my car and wobbled it, I could get out of it with that crowd that was coming to me, I came to the house. To Papa, who was a descendant of people from the Andes, and he said to me: 'Well, when do you marry?' I told her that it would be in August that my boyfriend would come to meet the family in May and I already had his ticket purchased.My schedule was full of celebrations and excellent meals.Then he said: 'Daughter, you're leaving already!' I replied that I could not do that because my daughters were in school and wanted to wait until they finished the school year. 'You do not stay here because it is an enormous danger that we are living,' he replied. Cancer that could be cured but it was complicated later.He saw things coming and did not want to leave his daughter alone, although I have many brothers.I asked him how he would do with the girls and he told me that in the USA I had entered as a girl myself A December and I had been accepted immediately.The papers would fix it quickly.It made me call my fiance from the same room and tell him that I would go directly to get married. Fortunately, my husband sent a kiss to my father and said he lost A ticket, but I was happy that I went away.I organized my papers, I came on March 22, 2002, and on March 28 I got married. I was on April 11, the coup in Venezuela.I think I made a good decision in that sense"". Mrs. Urdaneta said that when she applied for US citizenship, ""a lawyer cheated us, then pressured us back the money, applying for nationalization is very expensive, and the salary one earns only serves what is necessary to live."" She quickly settled the matter of her residence for being married to a United States citizen. He applied with his two daughters but gave it to her and the 10-year-old. The oldest, 18, was left with nothing and because she was of legal age could not legally harbor her stepfather in matters of immigration. The lawyers told her she could be deported. But she solved it as usually solved the legalities of the residence for a significant percentage of Venezuelans: ""She, fortunately, had an American boyfriend and he wanted to get married. She is a fashion designer, works for a good company in California and has a lot of social life with her husband."" The emigration of Angela Maria brought shortcomings: ""When I moved here I left my family, my friends, my work contacts, were many things that I lost when I came to the United States."" Her oldest daughter lives in Los Angeles and is 29 years old. The other is in Atlanta and is 19 years old. It was a consolation to take them with them, for the company they offered. However, both have been absorbed by American life. I missed the Spanish and tried to use it. ""I was threatening my youngest daughter with not answering her if she did not think about things in Spanish, and I did it."" She has already left the house, as young people in the USA do. ""It happened two months ago. She thinks that she must have her independence and the truth is that she does not seem bad to me because she is making her life, she is learning, and she is working, and here I had her very consented."" Angela Maria then feels a little alone. He is dedicated to his work in The Home Improvement, where he stands out with success. He commented that he won Thomasville Awards at Home Depot by designing ""the best kitchen of the year."" He also won the Georgia Stars for being the best in the refacing program, taking a kitchen and completely changing it just by changing doors and covering the sides with vinyl. But the work is hard, has even had to do it in schedule from 2 in the afternoon to 11 of the night. Now she's trying to get back to Miami where she's trying to get a job and where she thinks her husband will adapt. ""In Los Angeles, there is my daughter, but what happens is that she already has her life made. She is 29 years old and married to an American, she already has her friends.

"" It was at that moment that he could understand that politics did affect him and he wondered why he had not stayed in Atlanta with his brother when a couple of months ago he had had that opportunity. My father, who was a consultant as an engineer, worked with the government of Anzoátegui and told me that we would celebrate the birthday in Atlanta. "" We were living in Lecherías. His father planned to study high school in the United States, but he only wanted to go for a while and return to finish his career in Social Communication. In Venezuela were his friends and his rock band, as well as a show he performed on radio. He was the only one of his kind to have a radio program. ""We stayed for Christmas, it was January, it was February, Santa Maria had closed it after the strike, I stayed studying English, and in mid-July, my father announced that they had decided to stay in Atlanta."" They had not asked for his opinion. ""We're going to stay, period."" Carlos felt very bad because they did not take him into account. He understood that he was only 18 and that was why. They had decided their future. He is the youngest of five siblings, three of his father's first marriage, who were already living in the United States. ""Even though I knew people, I had no friends; I did not know how to locate them, I did not know how to drive here, the first four or five months I was not going anywhere outside the school or the house. He enrolled then to study communication at the University, where the students were older than him. It began to meet with Hispanic people and entered a stage of some rebellion. In his mind, he still wanted to return to Venezuela. ""Why study if I'm coming back?"" He wondered. ""When I got home I had problems with my dad because they were very low.I stopped studying nine months, during which I worked in a mechanic shop, sold auto quakes, glasses I was going to work, instead of studying. ""I went to work, instead of studying. Problems with my father.He told me that if it were for money, he would give it to me if I stayed in the school.I was 22.I remembered.I passed the first semester with good grades.It was important to me.I already felt socially acceptable. Then I went back to the rumba again, but keeping some passable notes, I went out with some girls and others. "" In 2006 he got a part-time job and did his internship on a rock radio. Carlos was very funny and hyperactive. He was tested on the air and called to stay on the show. He finished the internship at nine months. There it was in its environment. He was interviewing rockers. He spent it in clubs and concerts. In that bustle, the fumes went up in the head and met people who used strong drugs. ""I had the flames that I wanted until I met a girl who is my wife today."" One day I got arrested for drugs, and she was the one who was in charge to help me as a friend. I left the drugs, which made me sick Three years ago, one day she told me that she was pregnant and today she is the mother of our two twins, a girl, and a child. I will do them for myself. "" Carlos explains his vision of the country where he was born: ""Today I would like to go to Venezuela, but only to visit. Being a family father, I do not intend to live with her in the country.I have been more or less lonely all my life."""
"10","f",0,2003,"Elia Mata poses on the letters the anxious hand of his ""patient."" It could be trivial, but Elia serves to interpret the energy exchange that occurs there. Then, place your two hands on your client's and start your dynamic. It is the Tarot of energy. Elia tries to channel it by relating it to the things her ""patient"" tells her; They are usually things that are happening to that person. All this he learned in Caracas. Now 57, he is a resident of New Jersey. ""I came to the United States to stay posted on November 8, 2003. I came because my son has been here since 2000."" Elia does the same thing in New Jersey as she did in her last years in Venezuela. Before engaging in her mystical abilities, she had worked as an accountant for some companies, including Berol. But it was not his thing. Without an explanation for that, something called her to what she had realized had since her schoolgirl years. Then he entertained his companions in the bathroom, reading their hand. As a child, she began to have visions about matters that would later occur. But no one was paying attention. She was a very lonely child. ""I lived in Maiquetía, and La Guaira in very old houses, one of them had a lot of stories, and I could see people who were not myths but reality and could feel a lot of souls and things."" She states that she was the first woman to be diagnosed with Cushing Syndrome in Latin America, a disease related to excess cortisol in the body. Because of illness, he claims to have begun to feel revelations and manifestations. One of them miraculous, she says, with the Virgin, with which she committed to working within the mystical area, very out of the portfolio and nylon stockings. Elia has been living in New Jersey for eight years. He began his work attending the drunks of his neighborhood, and today he sees about five customers a day and dedicates to each one about two hours. Your room house is your workplace. There he lives with his only son, who is a musician and already became a citizen of the United States. He is the timbalero of India of New York, Jerry Rivera, Tito Nieves and Tito Rojas. His name is Carlos Padrón. After nearly a decade of staying in US territory, Elia will soon acquire her legal residency status, because her son has formally applied for her as an immigrant, her husband remained in Caracas. ""I'm married to him, but he does not decide my life."" Elia was fascinated by her new life in New Jersey. He will return soon to visit Caracas when he acquires his legal residence in the USA. ""I came because I really could not stand the insecurity. I was jogging in the morning with a group of women who had been going out since 5:30 and we could not do it anymore because they were waiting to steal us, seeing how the situation in the country was, for anything Began to fill me with anguish and every day I felt more locked in my house, When I arrived here my son was studying in Upper Manhattan, and when I mounted the subway and saw the Browns, I was always grabbing my son because I saw them very strange ""When he returned to Venezuela in 2002, I told myself that when I went back to New York I would not be returning."" But in addition to the sense of security, there was another thing that ended up taking root in Elia: the welcome so high that had its work. It is as if she felt she needed all the international community of people who began to consult her problems and her pains in New Jersey. ""It has been an enjoyable experience because the diversity of cultures has given me many lessons, satisfactions and also some sadness."" Elia alludes to two of her clients who committed suicide because of pressure: a 25-year-old Italian engineer and a Puerto Rican girl. She serves Americans, Chinese, Filipinos and, of course, Latin Americans, who find themselves in New York and New Jersey by millions: Puerto Ricans, Ecuadorians, Peruvians, people from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Brazil. The community that comes most to his office is that of Colombians. It tells that a person of an individual country arrives at him like ""patient"" and soon takes to others of the same nationality. ""There are a lot of people here that have orientation, people coming in are marked by situations in their countries, which I did not see in Venezuela, it has been a great school, I had to deal with many people, men and women, who suffered rape When they were children and come with that deep sadness, that they arrive in this country after crossing the border, working 18 and 20 hours a day to support their families in their countries.It has been very gratifying because the majority has resumed their life and find in Me to that person who dedicated that moment of attendance, which took to the tranquility of him."" Elia explains that in the relationship with his ""patients"" does not speak of ghosts but energy."" Energy is what allows me to see revelations of any situation, from any person,"" he says. For her, the Tarot is a therapy of spiritual response, a research on consciousness and soul. He also works with pendulums and crystal therapy, a physical massage in the seven main points called chakras. Explain part of his secret: ""There was an expression that marked me when I arrived. One of those drinks I told you about said to me: 'You know why I like to come here? Because you listen to one. You are not like most people in this country.You have no one to talk to here because one minute costs a dollar and they can not be losing it. ""Most of those depressions are because they have no one to talk to. The World with their rhythm of life, overwork, everyone walks on their own and have no one to talk to. "" When asked about how he sees his future in New Jersey, he responds that he intends to continue with his work, but with a larger space and away from home. ""At first Venezuela was very worried when I saw Globovisión on cable, I suffered a lot seeing the deterioration ... my son, who has traveled there, tells me to prepare because the Caracas that I left in 2003 is nothing like the Which is now.With my neighbors, we communicated, and they tell me that they can not use cell phones on the street.I'm biased ... but I'm going to see my mother who is 86. I do not want to be affected.I pray a lot for my country; I have a family member who works in the government and is afraid to call me here because they can intervene the phone and see you talk to a pitti-yanqui."""

After his discharge, he worked in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV). ""In both institutions, I saw in some way the deterioration that is, and that is filling a part, insecurity, instability, and nonconformity, are contradictory things according to the goals you are tracing and what I wanted as a quality of life."" He was the coordinator of security affairs of the BCV; Supervised 150 guards who are custodians, among other things. ""Once I was in the BCV, seeing options outside the bank, I was about to come to the US, the country of opportunity, I applied for a permit, and I came in. I did not get anything; I just saw a different environment. In 2003, so I had nothing sure I would invent and return. My girlfriend Audry and I were married in 2002 and in May of 2003 we came. "" Then at age 30, he spent a year trying to apply for the different visas, which are expensive. He did not know that, because of his status as a retired military man, he had the opportunity to apply for political asylum and that was what he did. He alleged the insecurity and several important events, such as a kidnapping in Caracas, which he said was part of a maneuver to people who knew that he handled a lot of border information and wanted to intimidate him so he would not speak. It was the argument he used and approved. ""I do not know if it was a common hamper or commanded by the Government, due to reports that I spent in my performance at the border and that later on arriving at the BCV, in a position of a certain authority, could take a position on the manifestations that were given Against the government.It could have influenced my kidnapping, you never know. "" Perez and his wife opened their businesses in Doral, Florida: Don Environ and Adan Logistics, which began operating well since 2005 in the licensing field for all air and ocean shipments. They have spent almost eight years providing logistics service. They have a client base in Venezuela, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and Panama, and plan to expand to Europe. They not only applied for permanent residence but when they turned five in the US became citizens of the United States. ""We were sworn in August 2011. Our two children were born here, one in 2005 and the other in 2007, and obviously with the ups and downs of this country gives us the opportunity to breathe and sleep peacefully.""

"12","m",1,2003,"Jose Colina Pulido, 37, is a Lieutenant in the National Guard, graduated in 1995. Amid the political turmoil of 2002, he decided to participate with the officials who protested in Plaza Altamira since October. He disagreed with Chávez's turn to military policy and rejected what he considered his understanding with the Colombian guerrillas and the participation of Cubans in matters of the National Armed Forces. There were then explosives in Caracas, and the government blamed several officials of Plaza Altamira, including him. ""The accusation forced us to go into hiding in the country. We were also blamed for the death of three soldiers from Altamira."" Lieutenant Colina and Officer Valera López were able to leave, and they went to Cúcuta, where they took refuge. They spent several weeks in a house doing nothing. And suddenly an armed group woke them up at dawn. They were paramilitaries. ""They took us to a point in Cúcuta to talk to the paramilitary commander in the area, who told us that they had detected us and that they thought we were strange,"" We said that we were persecuted officers of the Chávez regime. It was safe for us that the guerrillas could reach us equally, and if they caught us they would disappear, I told them that I had relatives in Valledupar and that I could go there, but he said that wherever I worked in Colombia, I would have problems because I was not from there. He asked us to leave. "" Without being able to take refuge in Colombia, both officers decided to seek asylum. The two had been in the USA and taken courses there. But this was complicated because there was an international arrest warrant presented by the Venezuelan Public Prosecutor's Office. ""We managed to get out of Colombia with the help of friends at the National Police, but at Miami airport, they would realize that we were wanted, that was November 2003. That's why we decided to seek asylum at the airport."" That happened on December 10, 2003. Colina told the immigration official that she was being treated for political asylum. He replied that he would do customs, check, go to a hotel and then apply for asylum in an office. Hill insisted that he wanted political asylum at the time. ""He asked me why and I told him that the Venezuelan government was following me."" The officer checked and commented that both were being requested. ""I said that that's what the persecution was about. We were not allowed to go back to Venezuela because we're asking for asylum."" The US policy states that in these cases, persons are sent to the Immigration Detention Center. They were sent from Krome, in Miami, where a prison term of two years and four months would begin. ""There were three colors of uniforms: blue, for those who have not committed a crime in the USA, Orange who have paid a sentence of one to five years and read for those who have committed violent crimes.If you are Guatemalan and you are condemned. By drug, after you are worth the sentence you are sent to this jail and deported to your country. It has a capacity of 500 people. Our uniform was blue. ""Venezuela requested the extradition and, to top it off, the US Attorney's Office said that both had gone to the United States to evade justice, the trial was still in the United States, plus the extradition process with the State Department. And four months until a judge granted protection under the UN Convention Against Torture. ""The judge did not give us political asylum. In the Court, we demonstrated that if we returned to Venezuela, we would be victims of torture. We had to stay in the US or go to another country until the conditions in Venezuela changed. ""The version did not sound believable for the US Attorney's Office, which appealed the decision and kept them in custody. To Tallahassee, to a joint jail, they were there for six months, with little contact with their lawyers, there were 50 people in a small room, a single telephone, few places to eat. 2005 we decided to strike a hunger strike to give us answers in our case. We finished it on January 2, 2006. We were sent to Houston, an immigration center with a hospital where we entered. In the United States, they respect hunger strikes only if nothing more than water is consumed. No way or sugar. The authorities were worried, and we agreed to suspend the strike with what was achieved. On April 28 of that year we were released; Restricted, but freedom. We had to report every three months to an immigration office and make a weekly call to a check-up office. ""Colina went to Miami and her partner to another state."" Patricia Andrade, a human rights activist, helped me. It was a factor for my freedom. I got home. I met Patricia Poleo (the interview took place at her house in Miami Beach) and other people with whom she fights for the exile of Venezuelans to be recognized both internationally and within Venezuela. I had a work permit and a Social Security card to pay my taxes. I renew it annually. Of 10 thousand applicants applying for Protection against Torture are given to one or two persons.

He comes from a family of leftist intellectuals. All his education was in public institutions. He got a scholarship from the French government to take a postgraduate course, and he did not think of staying in Europe, even though he likes it very much. Before returning Intevep hired her. He then earned another scholarship and did his Ph.D. at the University of Florida. ""And I did not stay because I had the conviction that I should be in my country because that was the place where they needed me.I was to apply my knowledge in my country 'She worked 13 years at Intevep and considered the experience incredibly rich."" We did not know What we had, ""he says today, because having left years ago, he has not found a company that looks like that and that PDVSA as a whole. Until the 2002 oil strike came. He claims that he was never on strike, But on vacation, but that anyway he was on the list of dismissed.He did not recover the money from his savings bank, nor the trust, nor the benefits nor anything.Everything was there in. ""We did not even remove the picture from the office. But fortunately Pdvsa was like Valle de Pasiones: single people were married. ""Her husband, whom he met at the state oil company, had already moved on to another private company. Black and we could not enter any state company. Many went to foreign companies. From Intevep we left 900 people. Of those 900, 250 were PhDs. The others were masters or engineers. Most of us had contacts abroad because we had done postgraduate and it was located abroad. The one with the least languages ​​had two."" For Mariana that was the damage done to the country: to get so many people out of Pdvsa companies. But there is another thing that worries him: ""99 percent of those who leave are forced into exile."" The life of an exile is not the life of someone who decided to leave. The vast majority of us are living well, but it must be made clear that it was a forced decision. "" Her husband worked in a spin-off company, and she went on to work at a private university as a graduate director. ""We were happy in Puerto La Cruz, living there without wanting to leave. There are two ways to work, one for salary and another, besides the salary, to feel that you bring."" That's the kind of job they wanted and were doing. Until the nationalization of the companies came and the second wave of oil emigrants came: ""My husband had to become an employee of PDVSA, to which he said no.I was not going to pay that price. The arena muzzle was not so Venezuelan oil professionals are excellent, the company where he was transferring a proportion of Venezuelan workers to the United States, among us, that was already almost four years ago, we chose to move us here. Mariana insists that she came only when the workspace was reduced to its minimum expression. Anyone from the oil area who wants to work has to be for the Government. And she was on a famous list. Those who signed for the recall referendum can not either. ""Our work space has been reduced to zero."" The couple with their two children had the possibility of going to Canada or the United States and decided to Houston. The United States had never drawn them to live, but there was not much choice. She soon also settled in another oil company. They had no financial problems to move. They were taken by a company that ran with all the expenses of the transfer. She still wonders why a company decides to invest money in bringing staff from another country to the USA. And pay you everything. ""As we happened to us it happened to a huge crowd of friends.All Petroleum companies have been in contact.We have many networks.Here in Houston, there are many because Houston is the oil capital of the world.Each Green Card was sponsored by them This fortune we had some of us who transferred us to the USA and gave us the Ll visa, with apartment, rented car to arrive, all the benefits and finally the Green Card is over, because now they can not bring people from outside when the When I was doing the interview for a job here, my interviewing boss told me that the most valuable professional engineers they had there were Venezuelans could you imagine how I felt when I heard that? Wrinkles heart. Seeing an American say that's an element that tells you that the quality of Venezuelan oil tankers is quite high. "" The family travels once a year to Venezuela, where the rest of she. They maintain the Venezuelan culture in Houston. ""My children are more Venezuelan than the arepas, most of the oil tankers live in the same sector, Katy, our friends, are the same as before, my children went to kindergarten with the children of many of our friends. The Venezuelan community here is very organized, and they do a lot of cultural events.We have masses, concerts, skateboards at Christmas, many things.I feel I have lived in Car and then in El Cafetal.Then I studied at the UCV.This country I miss it, more when I get into the news and see how it is I was all right in my country until everything was changed and I had to exile myself.

""First, there have been so many changes in the country over the last few years that my long terms are two years, we'll see what happens then, and then I want to go back at some point, I do not know what the children are going to do.

That was in 2004 when he was 43 years old. But deep down, since he did not see things well in Venezuela, and it was easy to run from there to get the papers of the residence, he stayed. By 2004, according to the UCV pension scheme, she was eight years away from retirement. She was a professor in the School of International Studies and the postgraduate course in International Relations. Married and divorced, she is a single mother of two boys who are 22 and 21 years old. Already in 2006, he had his documents of legal immigration. Today you are already paying for your home. ""What I did was basically for them,"" he said. The university lived the agitation and the first dodges of the violence that were maintained later. ""Since 2002 and 2003, I realized that the quality of the research was already in decline, and I was an authority in the UCV, and I suffered stressful situations like tear gas. Eight hours"". On the other hand, Eira feared for the safety of her children in the country. ""The quality of life of the teacher was less and it was increasingly difficult for me to support them,"" he felt. Eira Ramos left with a scholarship of 1,500 dollars per month. They served him to settle down and spend the first few years, when, incidentally, happened to his children something that is verified in almost all cases of young people who migrate to North America: they decided to remain in Canada. ""Once here, the boys started to study in their school that costs nothing and a year and a half did not want to return, they were integrated. Compared to here. They were above their area mates."" But Eira was not so fortunate. She tried to find work as a teacher, and she did not succeed. I needed a Ph.D. I did not have. Neither did it at the college level. He soon realized that he had to enter a company in some way and after having that beachhead begin to emerge by his talent and dedication. ""I started working as an office assistant, what I called years ago office boy, office girl in my case. I was sending mail to the different divisions and departments, express mail, I was in the company for a year and a half,"" I asked. What a Venezuelan teacher of postgraduate could feel like relegated to work as the office girl. ""I started to do training courses that the city of Toronto offers for new immigrants, to get what they are asking for, the 'Canadian experience,' to be employed. It was not exactly in a company, but a Immigrant where they use the so-called 'virtual companies', where you spend three months working in a firm that does not actually exist, but that allows you to put on your resume that you worked there, What I needed was a full-time job, with benefits. To say that it was what I wanted, but fortunately, I did not have to go through the stage of going to a Mc Donalds or, like some Hispanics, to cleaning companies, what is known in Canada as 'survival jobs.' The lowest level of the company, but it was a company that gave benefits, I had my vacations paid.It is a slightly higher level.In that first place, I was a year and a half.Then I was promoted to another position already in the department of Corporative accounts. There I began to learn many things and also gave me the opportunity to pay for studies related to the work I was doing. I took advantage of that opportunity and got a designation that serves me as a benefits administrator (human resources personnel of a company that is responsible for handling insurance and other benefits for employees. It was easier for her children to adapt to the new territory. They did so through the multicultural school system, interacting with teachers and learning about Canadian history. The first year they went from home to school and returned. But in less than a year they had friends and went out on their own. They sought out their first jobs at Mc Donald's on their initiative and shared time with their studies. She had to deal with the language barrier. ""My brain is not like that of the boys who assimilate English quickly.I had a hard time going out.I went to two courses as a listener at the University of Toronto, but I could only do it when my papers came out because without them Everything is complicated.You can not get a job; you can not attend the free English courses in Toronto. "" He spent those first two years doing his postgraduate course and at the same time postulating for the permanent residence. ""Meanwhile I also saw how to look for contacts, relationships to start opening a field within the city."" He visited Venezuela in January 2010. ""I miss the friends that I left, but I do not miss the state of life I had there, I miss college hours because I was extremely comfortable. My brother, who lives in Michigan, near Toronto, still has two weeks of annual leave and has 11 years of experience. I do not give myself luxuries, and I would like to have more money to travel to Venezuela every year, although from my country I reject the insecurity, fundamentally. To give you an example, my son told me that a friend went to a local chain of Tim Horton's coffee shops, ordered a coffee and in the background, there was A used band-aid. He hired a lawyer and ended with a settlement in the Court for which he was given $ 250,000 for the damage.

He bought three trucks and worked in that business, even driving, but he broke. As it had passed more than a year, the family became illegal, and that was a problem that Emilio tried to solve creatively. ""Someone recommended that I apply for an asylum to achieve legality in the USA, and I did it in 1996."" Emilio needed to spend more time in the United States because his daughters were studying. They agreed that when the girls finished high school the family would be returned to Venezuela. It would be futile to think that her daughters, once accustomed to life in Florida, wanted to return. In any case, the political petition had begun to move. ""The restrictions on asylum applications were not so strong at the time, and they were immediately responded to with a work permit until the case was decided in 1998. And if they were not pronounced three years later, the asylum was accepted At one time it could be applied for permanent residence "". Emilio had worked in Venezuela for the police and then invented a story about alleged persecutions of drug traffickers, who then sought revenge on him or his family. The 1998 reform came, with the restrictions and Emilio had not fulfilled the lapse of three years for automatic approval, so it occurred to leave the case and forget everything. ""It was not a real political asylum but my Chinese tale to let time pass and my daughters graduate."" He finished his English college. Her eldest daughter graduated, but was already absorbed by the North Americanism and wanted to graduate later in a university of the United States of America. He continued religiously renewing his work permit and continued to arrive at his house. In 2004, he received a letter saying that his asylum case had ended and, as he had not presented himself to the trial, ordered him to leave the country voluntarily at the end of a month. If he did not obey, he was exposed to deportation. ""I thought that they had thrown it in the trash, but the case had gone on in my absence, they had sent me subpoenas, but since I had moved, I did not receive them. I was not aware.My young daughter was studying.I could not go on, and I did not pay attention to him, and I kept working, they did not bother me anymore.I talked to a lawyer, and he recommended that I go."" Emilio renewed his driver's license, which gave him to work and live. Two years passed. He was in Alaska, and his wife became seriously ill in Miami because of bacteria. It remained quadriplegic. I could not move anything, just the lips. The doctor told him he was not saved. He sent her to Venezuela in an Aero ambulance. And he died a month. Her other daughter also graduated and remained in US territory. One married a New Yorker and went to the Big Apple. The other one did it with a young man from Miami and went to live in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. They resolved their immigration status. ""I stayed alone in the apartment there, so when I was preparing to come to Venezuela, I met a US citizen, and I started a relationship with her. I told the lady that I was missing her asylum trial, I found her Worse to Going, that he had a deportation order. She told me that she worked in a law firm, was a paralegal and found out. She told me that if we got married, she would make the family petition for me to get the Green Card. And so we did. ""But if some have a thesis, others come with the antithesis.

I have the regulations of that jail. We slept in the bunk; we only had two underpants per person, two pairs of socks, broken shoes that I inherited from another prisoner, like the US Keds but orange. They are giving to those who are arriving, used interiors and used uniform. I saw cases of people who had a year waiting. I met the case of Carlos, a Dominican who had a Year there and wanted to be deported because his mother was very sick in his country. He went to talk to the deportation officer to protest. They removed him from there and sent him to a psychiatric hospital, where he spent seven days in treatment, drugged. A week later a BTC doctor of Colombian origin arrived, who recognized him and asked him what he was doing there; They sent it back to the BTC. There was a German who was complaining that he had been sent there for the protest. A Salvadoran was beaten and his collarbone fractured. I was organizing a strike when I was transferred. The treatment we received was inhuman. I came in weighing 230 pounds and left weighing 195. But not for worries but food. When I entered there were five Venezuelans arrested there; When I left, nine. Of those two live in Charallave, one in Maracaibo. Omar and his sister are in Panama. ""The two legal proceedings continued: deportation and residency On February 20, 2010, a summons arrived at his house informing that he and his wife were due to appear on March 3 at the Immigration Service for A marriage interview for the granting of the residence."" On day 2, I was put on the plane and sent to Venezuela for the escort. Why? I do not know. ""On the return trip to her country, after 17 years, she was accompanied by two ICE officials, an American and a Latina of Colombian origin:"" She made me life squares before and during the flight, But I restrained myself and prevented him from putting my handcuffs in front of everyone. But he boasted that he was a policeman and showed that I was being detained. The American did not even talk, but she kept me going psychologically all the time. Maybe I felt morbid about it. Once we got to Maiquetía, as soon as we got to the Venezuelan immigration office, I said, 'Put on the handcuffs, you fucking pussy of your mother! Now you, motherfucker! ' The Venezuelan official intervened and asked me to calm down. I told him then, and I went on: 'Damn dirty. Latina, you had to be. ' Every time I remember that I upset. I warned him to come back. 'And you're going to see me over there because I'm married to an American,' I said. 'I hope not,' she replied. ""When I see you, I'm going to kick your ass, even if you put me in prison."" Emilio now hopes that his immigration process will be reactivated while his wife is in Florida. The National Visa Center already granted me a visa number. What I have is to wait now that I have money, 500 dollars to pass it to the (North) American consulate. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, between 12 and 16 Venezuelans annually chose to voluntarily return to the country after having been detained at the Broward Transitional Center. ""I am going to pay a thousand dollars, and it takes a year or two to process the matter,"" he assured me. In the same time, between 16 and 19 cases occurred of Venezuelans captured and detained at the Miami Krome Detention Center, who chose the same route of voluntary return, Without formula of judgment."
"16","f",0,2005,"Her name is Ines. He lives in a popular downtown suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. She lives in an enclosure of about 25 square meters, with only one room for her husband and her three-year-old daughter. ""It's ours,"" he says proudly. It is a small annex to a house, whose owners have helped her since she arrived in Atlanta in 2005. The place looks a little disheveled. They are more things to have than those that can fit loosely in the department. He is Mexican and works in construction. She is dedicated to tending the baby. Ines bases the happiness of his life on and for these two beings who accompany him and for whom he renounced much. She arrived in Atlanta at age 39 and today is 45. She left Caracas in late 2005 and lived legally in the United States for a while, until cases of force majeure made her accept immigration into lawlessness, as an irrevocable decision. He was born in La Guaira in 1965, grew up in Caracas and Nirgua (state Yaracuy) and then returned to the capital. He arrived on November 16, 2005 in Atlanta. He left because ""Venezuela depressed me."" She had worked for the last eight years as a secretary at the embassy of the Sahrawi Arab Republic. ""The day I left the embassy and arrived at my parents' house, I told the people who were there that they had prohibited to put news. That whoever put Globovisión, Venevisión, Venezolana de Televisión or something similar killed him. I did not want to hear news."" ""What did you want to avoid?"" I asked. ""The whole situation was stressful, and what made me leave the embassy was the political situation. You had to be there every day of what happened in the government of Hugo Chávez, the ministers, what each one said. And you saw that there was not a clear north, to see that this is positive, this is to enlarge, to grow. I did not want to hear another word of politics or know another word of Mr. Chavez. I left the embassy I obtained the visa, the documents to come to me. Coming to the United States was not something that provoked Chávez. It only provoked the political situation in Venezuela. I had it in mind for many years, perhaps not as a plan of life. Maybe I would like to come, meet, try my luck and if I was ok I would stay, but I would not like to be totally in the US I chose Atlanta, because this was where I had people known and those people opened their doors to me. And I asked for a visa extension here. I had to present a return ticket with a scheduled date and everything so that I could extend it for another six months. When they did, I took the opportunity to continue working. I came with $ 400 and another 500 at a bank in Venezuela with a prepaid card. I got a job packing chlorine. The first day I felt like the worker who comes down from Petare and must grab the jeep, then the Metro and another bus. I went with my lunch under my arm and having only half an hour to eat. That was something for me, it was like something that was not in my mind. That first day was very hard, were eight hours of standing, almost unable to ask permission to go to the bathroom. Stop in front of a band and you had to pass, raising the bottle and lowering the bottle, and then inside the box. I ended up with a horrible pain in the back. My mom would talk to me every day and tell me that I did not have to live that. I would say, ""What do you want me to do, Mom? In Venezuela, I do not have a north, if I must stay here to clean bathrooms, I'll stay here, it was very traumatic."" He was looking for security but he married an illegal one Packing chlorine, Ines earned seven dollars an hour. He worked eight hours a day and got about $ 250 a week."" Then I went to work at a hotel as a waitress, something that did not exist in my mind either, I mean, it brought me to live new things, when you get to a hotel room you find it clean and you do not know who it was to clean it, and to get to do that job, to really wash the bathrooms and get to change the sheets, vacuuming, at the beginning all that was very difficult. I had worked in another world, with an ambassador, inside something else, A totally different world. It was getting a little less than with chlorine. But the work was different, you had your dining room to eat, you did not have to ask permission to go to the bathroom and that someone denied it to you. I liked it more than being in the factory."" From her time in Nirgua, Ines welcomed the Adventist religion: And followed in Atlanta. ""When I arrived here I felt a little alone, because of the living conditions in this country. I arrived legal, but practically alone, I was not really prepared to be here in language, to handle, I could not buy a car. I started to see that your dependence is not only for your money, what you carry in your pocket, or your papers, no, your dependence is of God, and at that moment I clung much more to the Church. I attend the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In Venezuela, I went on Saturdays. But here it was constantly Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, all the time. ""She keeps the use of Spanish at home."" My girl listens to TV and her dad who speaks in English, but I always speak to him in Spanish. When I go to school I think she will have a notion because she knows how to say words in English, she says thank you, she says the numbers and the colors. She enjoys the cartoons in English and even laughs. ""Although they lived in contiguous areas, Ines and her husband knew each other deeply in the Church and that's where they came together."" It was very nice. In fact, he lived here in this house and I in the back. The lady owner has many annexes in this place. From here we went together on Saturdays to the Church. There we took care of the sound and everything that had to do with the com. Computer He wanted to learn and what little I knew I taught him. From there the relationship was born. When I went to Venezuela the first year, I already did as his girlfriend. I went because I had no choice but to renew the visa. I told myself that illegally I was not going to stay. I arrived in Venezuela and I spent three months, in February of 2007 I returned. It was very difficult with Immigration. It was the only time I felt like an ant. When I returned to Venezuela I forgot to give the airline the 1-94, which is the format they give when you enter the United States and that it shows that you left in the stipulated time. I took it. It turns out that when I tried to re-enter they put a lot of problems for that. They passed me to the Immigration office, where they treat you like the delinquent himself. You have no right to anything. All you do is sculpt. Each piece of paper, it seems they wanted to find something I do not know. I had gone to Aruba and found that in my passport. They asked me: What do you live for? What do you do? And that bothered them, knowing what I was doing. But they had their reasons because they also found documents of places where I worked here and that made the thing more difficult. Thank God, the officer gave me permission to be alone for less than a month. During that month, I arrived and applied for visa extension and they gave it to me for two more months. Then after that time I returned to Venezuela and stayed there for another six months. ""However, before leaving for Venezuela, Inés solved another important issue:"" I got married. The one who is my husband today had told me 'or you get married or you lose my sight, I do not want to see you again'. I decided to get married here, everyone here told me not to. Let me go to Puerto Rico and marry one of the island, not to do it with an illegal one. All those things told me, but for me other things have more weight: the value of a family, of finding love, of being with a person who really fills you. That has more value than grabbing and paying someone, getting married, two years to divorce me or perhaps more. Pay that person to do me the favor of marrying me. That's what a lot of people do here. But that was not an option for me. I was not supposed to have children because of my health problems and God has blessed me now with a beautiful girl. ""After three months of leave in Atlanta he went to Venezuela six months, so that Immigration could forget about her. ""I said that there is no return to Venezuela because my baby was born in Venezuela, was born in Mexico or born here, I preferred that Was born here in Atlanta, without right of reply. If I went to Venezuela they would not let me enter the United States again with my belly. And it was impossible to have her in Venezuela to bring her later, because to get a passport for a minor you have to take an intensive course, or you cannot get it. What is the government's plan to leave children without a passport? I do not know. It has been very difficult to be illegal, because you no longer feel the freedom with which I told you one could walk before. Especially with this situation of the laws on immigrants that are happening in all the United States. But I trust God, who is the only one who can give one's permission to be somewhere. If he says no more United States, then no more United States. ""I asked him if he feels inhibited to go to some places because of the illegality he is in."" To handle yes. One thinks, 'If I have to go to this place, I do not drive, but I'm looking for someone else to drive to do it'. But we go out, just as we go and we are confident in the hands of God. ""In any case, Ines has incorporated in his life values ​​of the society in which he now lives."" Look, the American is very respectful, if you are going to address A person does it with respect. In Venezuela, you go to buy bread and they say, my love, what do you want?'. Things like greet with one kiss, or a hug, here they are not done, nothing else shakes hands and if the other person considers it. There is a space. If you go somewhere, the American himself is friendly, but he always has his shelter and you end up being the same, with those same patterns. In this country, the word security is not a saying: it is a fact. Here, when in the first year I went to English classes at night and came in the Metro at 11 at night, I saw people with their clothes, which are not real gold, and you do not see anyone stealing. It is not that it does not happen, but it is not the common one of this country. You feel good, you go to a park and it is clean as the streets, you see the grass, it is green and cared for, you see gardens, it is cute that. You arrive in Caracas and what do you get? Bad smell on all sides, dirt. Here you call the police and you have them in three minutes. In Venezuela, you must say that you killed someone. ""Ines took a short time to respond when I asked her to describe the future I was seeing for her and her family in the United States."" I think there is no real future, because you can never really say I can adapt and get into everything that this country offers, because you really do not have the conditions to do it. We are clear that we are for a while, but for longer we cannot stay. If you want to grow, we cannot do it under the conditions we are in. I think my daughter does have everything she is: food, health, school, she has everything. If I got her out of here, the situation for her would be complicated. As long as, we can and we have the blessing of God to live in this country, for her sake we will do it. ""Ines and her husband have covered their health expenses, and she sees the decision to emigrate as positive."" stability. The only thing there was a job. I think what I earned was below what it would have to be; He lived very poorly. I always lived in someone else's house. This space is my house, although the rest of the house is not. But even this was not in Venezuela. There I lived from a friend's house to another friend's house. It was not stable under any conditions. I arrived here and found stability in every way. So much so that if I miss something of Venezuela is my mother, not even the rest of my family. I miss my mother and my friends, who were support, comfort and everything for me. Maybe that's why I did not miss Venezuela, for me it was very stressful. ""He was looking for security but he married an illegal girl. The girl interrupts the conversation and hugs Inés."" The girl will go to school when she turns four for five. And the school year starts here in August. But there are places where they are accepted in preschool. She would go there. I'm looking for something for her. I want to leave this confinement. When I was working in the hotel, my language was not the most viable, but I became a supervisor of waitresses, with a radius at the waist communicating from floor to floor. I quit that job and I locked myself in four walls because of the girl's pregnancy. It was difficult and I almost lost it. We lived in North Carolina at the time. There I spent my pregnancy, lying 24 hours a day waiting for my husband to come and take me a glass of water to bed. My birth cost $ 27,000 and was paid by the state government of Georgia; Although one is in an illegal state there is emergency Medicare in Georgia. I paid a thousand dollars at the beginning for my prenatal checkup. They assigned me the place where they would attend to me; Was at Foulton Hospital. I came from North Carolina because I felt very alone, even though there were many people in my Church. Atlanta was my space, what I know. ""Here, for example, you go to a post office to ask for your baby's passport, they take the picture, fill out the form, they will fill it out. You send it by mail and in five days you have it in your house. That's just a simple example. But I do not feel my homeland here either. If I were under another condition ... Venezuela is my land, it is the most beautiful thing in the world, but I do not feel the desire to return, to go and return. At 42 I had my daughter. Right now, I'm 45. I came here at age 39. I spent almost two years married, the six months I spent in Venezuela and then I had my little thing. Suddenly someone says, 'Gross, you should have married someone who had papers.' That is why I tell you that for me it was this, my family, my husband, a man who faces me. He thinks that from here we must leave because we have no security. Well, security is nowhere in the world, but this is where we are least safe. For the legal situation, for the papers. Because otherwise you leave the car key stuck outside and there the car dawns. It is not to be embarrassed by thieves. ""I would say that this family leads their quiet life, based on his work and the growth of his daughter. The husband earned $120 with me, arranging my Toyota Corolla 2000. I have seen her take the floor before the church auditorium and reflect on biblical passages. Meanwhile, he watched her proudly."
"17","m",1,2005,"Colonel Gustavo Días vivas's car exploded while it was parked in the Las Foundations building in Caracas on June 17, 2005. Within days, the officer decided to go to Alabama to seek political asylum. ""I worked with the Mendoza group. I was interviewed at El Nacional and El Universal, I went to Miguel Ángel Rodríguez's program at RCTV.Everyone was scared, then there were threats for co-workers, they threatened To all the people in the building, they threatened my son, the bomb was on the 17th and I had to come on June 22nd. "" This colonel used to get into the political limelight. He left a certain national anonymity when he appeared on TV as a member of the Military House, protecting the de facto president Pedro Carmona Estanga in a public statement in the midst of the events of April 12, 2002. He was in protest with the military in absentia In the Plaza Altamira. And in November 2002 he was retired in the Armed Forces. He then continued in political activity against the Chávez government. He claims that he did not want to leave the country but that the situation forced him to avoid harm to his family or his co-workers. He lives in Birmingham. He went to Alabama because his brother lives in that state. ""Apart from that, the United States did not sign the Inter-American Convention on Asylum and asylum here in the USA is different, here you can declare to the press. One makes the application here and legalizes the status until they approve or not and there is no risk, you have Your freedom of expression guaranteed, ""he says. He arrived on June 22, 2005. He applied for asylum on July 20 of that same year, made his interview on August 12 and already had asylum on October 6. He explained that he had submitted all the evidence about the explosion of his car. ""I sent the video with the interview with Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, newspaper clippings, Altamira square, April 11, interviews, emails. My friends had warned me to take care of them, they were going to do something for me. I put all that in. An Atlanta lawyer supported me, because the interview has to be done with a lawyer present. "" The asylum brings the document to obtain a work permit and all the benefits of social security, medical, among others, including work training, languages ​​and other things. This colonel left the country alone. But soon he was joined by his son, who is now in his 19 years. ""He is studying here, he is very identified, he has adapted, he has made his relationships, he has no friends in Venezuela, his friends in Venezuela were those in the sixth grade."" Diaz Vivas has had tough stages. He remained unemployed for two years in a time of crisis, during which he was helped by forced unemployment insurance and some churches. ""The company where I worked closed and fired everyone, from the manager to the last worker, who made aluminum doors, but I had some benefits like unemployed, that was an advantage."" In Caracas he only has his father's grave. And all that remains of his family. They must change the conditions for him to return."

""I arrived (in Miami) on March 23, 2005. I left the country because by order of the Prosecutor's Office 19 I was transferred to Tribunals, I had a warrant and arrest warrant."" The early days of the government of Hugo Chavez had the consent of this Judicial Branch, who had been National Director of Modernization of Justice with the support of the World Bank during the second government of Rafael Caldera. ""When Chávez won the elections, he called me (the official residence) La Viñeta, and I took a copy of all the functions of that project, and I asked him to finish it, I had a very good image because of my decisions as judge and magistrate Development of that project, which incorporated the whole country. Chavez ratified me in the position, like other figures, to give the image of amplitude and that was not communist. The honeymoon lasted until the National Constituent Assembly intervened the Judicial Power. She sent a letter to Chavez explaining what was happening, but she never got an answer. ""I stayed in the Judiciary until January 2000, and from that moment I denounced what was happening in the Judiciary, I participated in Citizens' Assemblies, we are dedicated to highlighting active citizenship, I was a total militant in newspapers, radio, and TV, I went to When the events of April 11, which were classified as a coup d'etat, but which in my concept simply constituted a power vacuum, I went to the Danilo Anderson, being the fourth prosecutor, chose from the 400 that were there to 37 people and I was accused of conspiracy to overthrow the government of Venezuela "". He said that a few years later, in La Lagunita Country Club, General Garcia Carneiro attacked a neighbor on the block who had shouted: ""Damn the soldiers who murder his people."" They were times of guarimbas, the spontaneous barricades that the neighbors armed in the streets and avenues, mainly of the east of Caracas. Parra admits that she participated in that when the referendum revoked. The residents of La Lagunita met the general. She tells it this way: ""There was a peaceful protest of cacerolazo and there I was charged with charges of crime and attempt to enter a house of the general, but those events did not happen.When the police arrived there was nothing happening that was not the I was sentenced to court with arrest and arrest warrant, and I had to leave the country on the green roads. "" He chose the United States because he has two relatives in Miami and is closer to Venezuela. His desire is to return to Caracas ""when democracy returns to my country."" A year before leaving he lost his only son and suffered two strokes. They did not affect it either intellectually or motorically, but it is a long process of recovery. She gave breast cancer, just got out of three operations. A former magistrate went out on the green roads ""I am extremely affected.I'm not a young girl.I never wanted to leave my country.It is a great damage what has happened.There are professionals who have had to handle trucks or wash floors.This golden exile that people think we're living here is totally false."""
"19","f",0,2006,"A professional from the lower middle class outweighs social changes. This story is about the social ascent, an improvement in the quality of life and the meeting of a better future for a daughter. Irma worked in Caracas for a major international computer company and toured to various countries in South America. In these trips arose a relation with a companion of work that also traveled from Atlanta and that proposed marriage to him. She left in 2006 with 33 years and being the single mother of a girl of five. He had a degree in Business Administration. He comes from a low-middle-class family, very poor and humble, who lived in the parish of El Valle in Caracas. Irma's story is that of overcoming at the cost of study and work, is the typical review of a case of the formation of the strong middle class that exists in urban areas of Venezuela. ""I did not come for Chavez or the economic situation,"" he confessed. He lived in the urbanization Los Samanes, a middle-class sector. His work had made him have no debts and had his car and apartment paid. Her daughter went to an excellent private school in Colinas de Tamanaco. ""Despite the security problems, everything was quiet for the two of us."" Irma felt clashes as she began her life in the United States. He came to the world of the gringos, not the Latins. I did not know Hispanics in miles around the house, and things are more difficult when there are not people close to their own culture. ""I was told that my daughter had to go to bed at seven in the evening and have dinner at five in the afternoon, I did not eat dinner, because I took care of my figure, I used to go to bed at about nine o'clock in Venezuela because I did not let her see novels. The Nana helped me. It's the cultural shock."" Irma changed not only the food but also the language, the climate and the type of social relations. Many things were different; The American gets up early and goes to bed extremely early. The attention that the American society gives to the little ones made him think that ""this country belongs to the children."" They occupy an important space and the norms protect them. Therefore, his daughter did not have many problems of adaptation. ""But when I arrived and did not have anyone who spoke Spanish, I realized how difficult it was going to be. I started a career to meet people like me, professional people who moved here and did the same as me, trying to survive.” Everything seemed very nice and orderly, but Irma was aware that unless she had a real need to live here, it was very difficult to connect with all those difficult changes. She married 14 days after arriving in Atlanta. ""I was so depressed by all these changes that I did not even get the papers for permanent residence. I needed my family, my sister and my brother, my mom, my grandparents."" What had I gotten myself into? As if I had burned the bridge because I had left my job. My family could not come to Atlanta because they had all been refused the visa. I had mixed feelings about living with the person I loved, and I thought I would live with it all my life ... I sometimes wondered if it had paid off."" After three months, he introduced the papers for permanent residence. She had taken a few thousand dollars from Venezuela and lived on it even though she did not have an immediate need to work since her husband had a home. Irma took it for granted that the cultural shock would see him overcome when he got a stable job in Atlanta. He initially looked for the same international company where he worked in Caracas, but this one was busting people. Then he contacted scouts. ""I came in April, and I found work in January. That's like six interviews until you get to the point. I was lucky. I was called from many parts. Two offers I had. He asked me how much I wanted to win; I said a number and they said they would pay me. I Had done an internet research, knew that it was better and easier to look at telecommunications and health because a recession was coming as a result of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I focused on that, and I came in telecommunications."" Her husband, who is 100 percent American, does not even speak Spanish. He never clearly assimilated that she was an immigrant, but that she thought and acted as if she were the same person who worked with him in Ecuador. Her five-year-old daughter did not want to speak English at first. It was her way of reacting to the fact that she had been moved from Venezuela. But then English was a necessity for her. It was his way of gaining freedom to communicate with other children. She could go out alone to play with friends on the street. He learned in record time, made it fluid in three months. ""Latinos are proud of who we are, we adapt to survive here, but the Latin we carry inside. I try to forget, but I've had and experiences. There have been episodes at school, with teachers. They distribute the salons, and they put my daughter with all the Latinos, but her friends are all American and then she is left alone. I told the director: we are being classified. It's a public school. I remember that last year my daughter told me that she did not like Mathematics class. I researched and was in a class with Latino cigars, and they were lagging, that the parents do not speak English and do not understand, and my daughter was doing great. I told the teacher that I was bored and that all I did was translate for Latino children. Then they passed her to the advanced class. ""Irma also had to encounter two types of cold: climate and people."" In the winter, I thought I was going to die; I did not understand how people could go to work. I felt a sense of guilt when I sent my daughter to school. ""Georgia is a very conservative state, but in the southern United States, people are affectionate compared to other areas, some considered her to be inappropriately dressed. The wives of some neighbors. But his dress did not teach anything improper. His father-in-law almost had a heart attack when he saw her in a bikini and then had to buy whole bathing suits to avoid uncomfortable situations. It was striking that in the meetings, The women talk to women, men to men and children to children, she was not like that, and she talked to everyone, they also looked strange because she worked. ""I was often not invited to meetings. There came a time when all my friends were foreign, Dutch, Cuban and Colombian ... What is it that I am strange because I work? ""From the relationships, so formal that Irma was living then, missed the generosity of Venezuelan affections, The informality of the contacts. It was the structure that made him long for improvisation. For a while, he thought that he would get used to the life of the Americans until he met another Venezuelan in a hairdresser and a Brazilian who helped set up a company and Then invited her to her marriage, to the birth of her son, and to the baptism. ""These informal relationships became a familiar bond."" Latino friends are treated like family. ""She launches with a typical middle-class approach. Venezuelans in the United States as a generation that ""did not cross the border on foot but was brought by the company."" They are professionals and set up their own businesses. ""That's the biggest difference from us. We always go through the big door. I did not look for work in an address, but in a company like the one, I worked in Caracas. I feel already inserted here. But I do not rule out returning when I retire. I bought a house in Margarita or Puerto La Cruz, near the beach. Because what would I do here alone? I have no family here. If my daughter would want to go to Venezuela, the most logical thing is for me to go too. I go to Venezuela every year and every time. A professional coming from the lower middle class goes beyond the social changes that I see. I see regression in values, crime, the evils that afflict it, but there is something very intrinsic that has not been lost: joy. There are families who are faced with political problems and come together at parties and wakes. Things happen for some reason, and you can find something positive."""

There was no guarantee that a fair trial would occur, because sadly in Venezuela there is no independence from any of the Powers of the State. "" He said that during the trial ""I came to feel foreign in my country, a negative feeling, on the one hand, but it has a positive side: it forces you to seek new horizons."" Then I realized that it was time to emigrate. Hilda and her family chose the United States because they consider it a country where there is a consolidated democracy, where the judiciary works. ""I documented myself sufficiently on how, why, and in what cases the US grants political asylum, and everything indicated that I was a candidate to benefit from that protection. ""Rebuilding life in another country requires a great deal of emotional, physical and intellectual effort and it is necessary to concentrate all the energy on that."" When I arrived in Miami, I had the impression that I was in a very modern urbanization in Caracas, because of the political climate Is breathed on the street and because the media have extensive and profuse coverage of the events of Cuba and Venezuela. Miami is a highly politicized city and in that it is very similar to Caracas. ""He commented that in Miami many Venezuelans participate in this kind of obsession for the news of Venezuela"" and I fell into that for a while until I stopped to reflect and I came to the conclusion that I should focus on rebuilding my life here. In that sense, it helps me that I now live in Houston, where most of the immigrants are of Mexican or Central American origin, and only Venezuela is named when there are violent acts there. ""It was hard for everyone, but particularly for his son, who Then he was only 15: ""It's age when friends are the universe,"" Hilda said. He had a hard time adapting, especially because he said that he did not want to live here, but in Caracas, where his parents were. And conversing with other Venezuelans, the experience was the same in all newly arrived families whose children were already teenagers. When they are small children, they adapt quickly and without resistance. ""Five years have passed, and he has adapted very well, assimilated English very quickly (it is the advantage of the young people) and for his good asylum journalist he restores his life in Houston ""I am grateful to God and this country, the United States, for having welcomed us and supported us. When you emigrate, you must learn everything again. It's like being born in another country but as an adult. You get several barriers; the first is the language: learning to speak it costs more in adults. And it is required that you speak it even in the simplest jobs. The second: documents, fixing immigration status takes at least six months to a year, time in which you must live off your savings because you can not work without documents. The third: cultural. You have to start making new friends. This is key to achieving the complex process of adapting to the customs of the new environment. This is a very hard process, but as long as you have a positive attitude, the road becomes more bearable. Seeing the good side of the new reality is key. """
"21","f",0,2006,"Patricia arrived in Orlando in 2006, when she was a woman of 40 years. She had lived in Mexico City for a long time with her husband and, after five years of legal action, decided to divorce. He stayed with the two children, she who was then 9 and he was 13. Her ex-husband took almost everything else. He discarded returning to Venezuela, where he had left in 1993. ""I did not think it was an option for insecurity and that there is no food, my friends find it difficult to get food, and everything is expensive. My friends from Caracas "". He has family in other cities of the United States, but this did not help him. From Mexico met some friends who had a cleaning company in Orlando in which they offered to work. With a few thousand dollars in the portfolio began his migratory adventure in the USA. Patricia started to work for this firm, rented an apartment, enrolled her children in school and, as in Orlando the places they frequent are very separated and there is no good transportation service, bought a car. It was already installed. Soon he decided that he could have his own business of cleaning houses and not doing it for others: ""Now I have my clients and I have all the money left to me,"" he says and adds that he is independent of everything, including taxes, Because it does informal work. What was not resolved then and now is not your legal residence in the USA. That had been offered when a Venezuelan arrived who said she was a lawyer, but it was a fiasco. She has had to get used to this type of work to make a living, although she has a degree in Psychopedagogy in Venezuela, where she worked. He did not do it in Mexico because there he dedicated himself to attending to his children. ""I registered them in the school barely when they were in a legal situation in this country,"" he said. They are accustomed to making their life independent ""so that tomorrow, if I miss, or go to college, they can go it alone."" You do not have a valid driver's license. Every six months you must change insurance on the car, and even though you know you have the license expired, you have not been charged the price or have been told never to cover it. Patricia and her children quickly inserted into life in Orlando, but it took about three years to stabilize. That is, only from 2009 she has not had to resort to her savings to keep part of the expenses. ""I do not have a job every day, but with what I do I can pay the rent and everything else."" My son helps me, he does not have a Social Security number, but he arranges gardens and sometimes does computer jobs that pay him. "" Among Patricia's shortcomings in Orlando is the couple. ""I did not get it, it's terrible. I do not know why, but I've been single for over five years."" She learned English in Venezuela. He did not develop it much later, but practicing it every day has helped him to get his gringos from Orlando. Despite her situation, Patricia has never felt discriminated against in her life in Florida. ""I do not know much about Latinos.My clients are all Americans, and I have a group of friends that we see each month.I have little contact with Venezuelans because I have not had a good experience with them.I do not know if because of the situation they have lived there In Venezuela or here, they want to make a profit to earn money. Once one gave me a queue, and in the end, he asked me to pay him for the transportation. "" He says he does not like Venezuela ""the president we have and what he has ended up being."" ""The last time I went the people were very aggressive, rude, I did not feel like going back, although then I could do it every year."" Insecurity was one of the things that made me move from there. I do not want to go back to a country where I have nothing to offer my children, compared to what I had when I was little: freedom to move everywhere, to go to the streets without That nothing happened, to go to school, that I would not be curtailed what I was going to learn, a supermarket full of things accessible to the whole world.You could travel, and everyone thought that Venezuela was a wonderful place to live.I'm hoping that in some If I do not, I would not stay, but I would try to look for another life in another place, which is not very good. Easy, if nobody wants to move within their country, imagine from one country to another. """

""I was suspended for two months with unemployment and Otep was one of the businesses that were most affected.His president was the Fedecámaras representative for the energy sector and openly supported unemployment.At that time my husband had the idea of ​​living outside Venezuela A time, something that I did not want.We explored a little Canada.At that time I was pregnant, and my boss told me that in what I ran out of the immobility could not have me.When it was over, I left.I went to a company in the area I did not see myself moving, but since I did not have a passport of another nationality, we did not have a better alternative than Canada, which had many things together.I became pregnant again.After I had the second baby, I officially filed the papers in May 2005. I applied for the residence from Venezuela, for what they call a qualified worker's visa.It took two years and a few months to get it.At that time the legal profession qualified for the resident visa.

There is a lot of help from the government, centers that help how to look for work, To understand the Canadian market, to adapt your resume. The attitude towards the immigrant is totally positive. I imagined the weather so horrible that when I passed the first winter, I concluded that it was livable. Toronto, after Vancouver, is the city with the best winter weather. If you compare with Montreal and Calgary, it is not so long. But we also had a summer of 40 degrees, with lots of suns, where we went to the beach. I liked having the different stations. I knew that I had to give up some customs of Venezuela, adopt other here and that everything would not be perfect. "" Elena already spoke English. Her husband has improved a lot.

"24","m",1,2009,"A sexagenarian was leaving his house in Maracaibo only 500 meters away. Antonio Villalobos has two years living north of Atlanta. At age 67, he preferred a quiet life and not the stressful situation he used to live in his residence in Maracaibo in recent times that inhabited that city. When asked why he emigrated, his answer is precise: ""My plan was to come on this date, but because of the insecurity that is experienced in the country I anticipated the trip two years. Citizen, I was going to ask in 2011, but I came in 2009. Even a grandson of mine almost killed him in front of my house for trying to take the car away from my daughter. And he lived in an area of ​​a good social level. There are no areas that can be said to be excluded from insecurity. Wherever insecurity sleeps and lives. I felt cornered. I left my house only 500 meters around. Even to the places I frequented as Café Bambi, for coffee and meeting with friends, had already made several assaults. If I had to stay, I could get them to make a robbery while I was there."" To legalize his situation in the United States, Antonio Villalobos requested an extension of his initial stay of six months. The two months before the deadline expired. He presented as justification for the extension of the visa the need for medical check-ups. He had to go to his appointments with the cardiologist who treated him in Atlanta. He also argued that in the US four of his granddaughters reside ""and that he wanted to spend more time with them."" ""That has been enough, I extended it three times, I have not been back to Venezuela since I left."" Antonio Villalobos worked in Venezuela for the oil company until 1987. He then did it with a state shipping company for 15 years. Finally bought some real estate and lived a bit of that, the sale and rental of real estate. ""That was another reason I came in. The strategy Chavez was applying with the expropriation of real estate, I said: 'I'm going to sell part of my real estate to avoid losing everything.' Of Tenancy that practically decapitalizes the real estate owners. I hope that the little that remains there is not lost. He has five children. The three men live in the US and the two females in Venezuela with their respective husbands. In part, the family is separate. He regrets it and wants his two daughters also to be in the United States. But he admits that ""that's a decision of them as a family."" He thinks that perhaps because he is a very organized and orderly person, he likes so much to live in the United States. He satisfies himself by observing day by day that in Atlanta ""there is not the live one that gets in the queue"". Otherwise, he has his three children, whom he saw very little and his granddaughters, who were growing up unrelated to their grandparents. ""From the point of view of the family, being able to give the warmth of the grandparents also influenced my decision to come. Also, here I have my house, my car and I have a job."" Mr. Villalobos advises a company in Atlanta. He had envisioned living this life since 1992 when he sent the first of his children to study. Everything had a plan behind it. Juan Carlos is already a US citizen. Then came the other two, Carlos Eduardo and Antonio Ramon. When they went to study, they did so for staying. ""Once the road is gone made by someone, and everything was easier."" Villalobos sold almost all of their properties in Venezuela before traveling to settle permanently in Atlanta; others sold them while already in the US"" While doing the paperwork of transfer and seeing that the Bolivar was devaluing More, I realized that I had to sell as soon as possible because of the change control. With that, as my children have always been working in restaurants, have been managers and knew the business well, I told myself that the shot is to set up a restaurant for the boys. The rest is a car, a house and make a living here."" The place is called Gordo's New York Style Pizza, located at 2590 Peachtree Industrial Boulevard in Duluth, Georgia. There I attended, and we talked for an hour with tequeños by means that made bring off the kitchen. But neither his business nor his money used them as a bridge to achieve permanent residence in the United States."" I'm getting it because my son is an American citizen V is asking me. The only way you get a visa is that you have a business in Venezuela and you want to open a branch of that business in the US, In fact, I have a friend who came With me, who has a prosperous business in Venezuela. It was also because of the personal insecurity. Transmitted the papers of his company of 15 years, the briefcase companies do not work. The requirements are demanding. It must be documentation that proves what that company was doing in time, records with financial and banking account statements, showing the longevity of that company. The L-1 is thus processed. He got it practically two months, and now he's in the process of residing. But if I got here and started a business, that would not allow me to get the resident visa. ""His routine includes a lot of sport, minimal cycling four times a week. He is entertained by family gatherings at home and work while Advises that company. He describes his decision as very good, ""because every time I see that the situation in Venezuela is getting worse. I am one of those who thinks Chavez will not come out of power, regardless of whether there are votes, that will seek the form and way to perpetuate itself and that project will not be truncated because someone votes against. The proof of this is that most voted 'no' in a constitutional amendment referendum and anyway its content was applied with subterfuges. Equal will happen with the 2012 elections. Definitely. ""What he would not recommend is for someone to go to the USA to venture. He warns that it is a difficult country, especially if the language is not dominated because that will greatly affect the relationship with the others since many Venezuelans perceive the Americans as people with whom a friendship cannot be established. ""People say that the gringo is bad people and I think the opposite. First, because I have lived with them, I have many American friends. When I played tennis, my friends were gringos and now with cycling, in the group with which I walk, the only Latin is me. We go out; we invite to training, they write to me by mail about what is going to be done. It's a nice group. In 1993 when we bought a townhouse, to our surprise, the day after arriving we found a paper at the door: we were invited to the house next door to meet our neighbors. Of course, if you do not speak the language is very uphill. When you cannot communicate the situation becomes very complicated."""
